"13 December, 2023 ","Gujarat: AAP MLA Bhupat Bhayani resigns, says ‘AAP not a proper platform to work for country’; speculations of two more MLAs leaving the party",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/gujarat-aap-mla-bhupat-bhayani-resigns-set-to-join-bjp-again/,"Bhupat Bhayani said that only due to nationalist ideology, he decided to leave the Aam Aadmi Party and has taken this decision after discussing it with the people of his constituency.In Gujarat, the Aam Aadmi Party suffered a major setback before the Lok Sabha elections. AAP MLA Bhupat Bhayani resigned from the party and the post of MLA on Wednesday (13th December). He has said that he is leaving the Aam Aadmi Party due to nationalist ideology. The speaker of the Gujarat state assembly has accepted Bhayani’s resignation.Bhupat Bhayani said that only due to nationalist ideology, he decided to leave the Aam Aadmi Party and has taken this decision after discussing it with the people of his constituency. It has been only one year since the assembly elections. The MLA’s exit has also dealt a major blow to AAP’s preparations for the Lok Sabha elections. On Wednesday at 10:45 AM, Bhayani handed in his resignation to the Assembly Speaker, Shankar Chaudhary. The Speaker announced that Bhayani personally delivered his resignation today, and it was duly accepted.The Aam Aadmi Party is preparing to contest elections in Gujarat under the I.N.D.I. alliance. Bhupat Bhayani said that he was earlier in the BJP and was associated with the ideology of nationalism. He said that he was going to leave the Aam Aadmi Party and join the BJP only because of the ideology of nationalism.Bhayani said, “I cannot be against PM Modi and I belong to nationalist ideology. That is why I have decided to leave the Aam Aadmi Party. Aam Aadmi Party is not the appropriate platform to work in the interest of the country.” Although he did not clarify when he would join the BJP, he accepted that he would join the party for sure. He said that if the party wants, he will contest the election once again.Bhupat Bhayani, a BJP member for 14 years, joined the Congress and won the 2017 elections. Then he made a surprising shift to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) just before the 2022 elections. Winning a seat as an MLA from Visavadar on the AAP ticket, he faced talks of resignation within a week of his victory. Initially, he deferred the decision, stating that he would consult with the people in his constituency before concluding. However, a year later, he decided to step down from his legislative position. This resignation has once again disrupted the functioning of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly. Throughout the past few decades, the assembly has not consistently retained its full complement of 182 legislators, with disruptions occurring due to various factors such as the passing of a legislator or changes in political affiliations.AAP state president Isudan Gadhvi has said in his first reaction that the BJP is running a dictatorship, and forcing MLAs to resign. He said that the BJP is afraid of Aam Aadmi Party.Currently, only four AAP legislators remain in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly, and they may also encounter challenges in the run-up to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. It is speculated that 2 more MLAs from the Aam Aadmi Party may also resign. According to a report by Divya Bhaskar, after the resignation of Bhupat Bhayani, now Botad MLA Umesh Makwana and Gariadhar MLA Sudhir Vaghani can also resign. The report said that MLA Makwana will make an official announcement soon.According to a report by Zee 24 Kalak, Sudhir Vaghani is also unhappy with the party and can leave the party at any time. But in a conversation with TV9, Sudhir Vaghani denied these claims and said that he was not resigning. There was no statement from Umesh Makwana in this regard.AAP MLA, Sudhir Vaghani denied leaving the party, criticizing #BhupatBhayani's action #Gujarat #TV9News pic.twitter.com/oxU5Wp17jfSimilar claims are being made in many other reports and it is being said that two more AAP MLAs may resign. It is also being speculated that all the MLAs of the Aam Aadmi Party will leave the party before the Lok Sabha elections. There is also talk of the resignation of a Congress MLA.The Aam Aadmi Party won only five seats in the Gujarat Assembly elections while losing deposits in 128 seats. The five seats are Botad, Gariadhar, Visavadar, Jamjodhpur and Dediapada. The MLA of Visavadar has already resigned. It is said that the MLAs of Gariadhar and Botad may also resign. Meanwhile, Chaitar Vasava, the MLA from Dediapada, has been absconding for several weeks in connection with assaulting forest department workers.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",‘Don’t make us reactivate earlier order of attaching Delhi ad budget’: SC warns Kejriwal govt of tough action for not releasing funds for RRTS...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/sc-warns-kejriwal-govt-of-diverting-deljis-ad-budget-if-it-does-note-release-fund-for-rrts-project/,"The Supreme Court then gave 7 days to the Delhi government to release the funds for the project, asking it to strictly follow the schedule of investmentOn 13th December (Wednesday), the Supreme Court issued a stern warning to Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal government over the delay in providing funds for the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS). The court observed that the Delhi government should refrain from compelling the court to pass ‘tough orders’. The bench noted that if the Delhi government doesn’t pay its share of dues for the project, it will be forced to reactivate the earlier order and attach the AAP government’s advertisement budget.  Notably, in November this year, Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Sudhanshu Dhulia directed that if the Delhi government fails to allocate funds for the Rapid Rail project, the amount will be redirected from the Arvind Kejriwal government’s advertisement budget for the current year.During the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had observed that the problem was that the Delhi government could make a budgetary provision of Rs 580 crore for advertisements but it could not make a budgetary provision of Rs 400 crore as part of its share for the vital infrastructure project.Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had said, “If such national projects are affected, and if money is being spent on advertising, we would be inclined to ask the money to be directed to the infrastructure”.Pertinently, the Supreme Court was apprised today that the Delhi government has still not paid its share for the RRTS project during the ongoing hearing on pleas concerning air pollution in Delhi. Adv: The Delhi government has still not paid (its share of RRTS).Sr Adv S Muralidhar for Delhi government: The minute the government of India (officially) approves the project, we will release these funds. NCRTC website says Centre has not.#SupremeCourtResponding to the charges, the Delhi government’s counsel Senior Advocate S Muralidhar defended the delay in funding. Muralidhar argued that the Delhi government will release these funds when the government of India officially approves the project. He claimed that the NCRTC website says the Centre has not done it, adding that Delhi-Alwar and Delhi-Panipat Corridor projects are yet to be approved by the Centre. The advocate claimed that Delhi govt has made budgetary provisions for the projects, and the funds will be released after the projects are approved.In reply, the bench warned, “These are new excuses (smiles). We are not afraid to pass tough orders. If you do not pay why will even other States pay.” The court also noted that other states have released their share of the funds, and therefore the Delhi govt also should do the same.The opposing counsel pointed out that these projects are sanctioned through international plans and delays escalate the cost. SC: Mr Muralidhar you will make me reactivate my earlier order (of attaching Delhi ad budget).#SupremeCourtThe bench stated, “Mr Muralidhar you will make me reactivate my earlier order (of attaching Delhi ad budget).” The Supreme Court then gave 7 days to the Delhi government to release the funds for the project. The court strictly directed the state govt to abide by the schedule concerning the allocation of funds for this project.Meanwhile, earlier on Monday (11th December), the Supreme Court had slammed the Delhi government over its ‘lackadaisical approach’ towards providing funds to the Delhi High Court and district judiciary for infrastructure development.The bench was headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and included Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra. The bench said, “What is happening? What is your government doing? You don’t want to give any funds to the Delhi High Court? We need approval by Thursday. It is a model High Court and look at the condition. Judges are undergoing training and there are no courtrooms.” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Several opposition leaders have lambasted the state government and temple management authorities for gross mismanagement and for allegedly diverting more security personnel for Kerala CM Pinnarayi Vijayan’s statewide trip. It is alleged that the authorities didn’t provide adequate police security for management and crowd control at the Sabarimala pilgrimage and didn’t make arrangements for basic amenities for Sabarimala devotees. State BJP president K. Surendran accused the LDF government of sabotaging the Sabarimala pilgrimage. He stated that the Vijayan government has ignored the Sabarimala pilgrimage for its own vested interests as the pilgrims are having a very tough time with facilities appallingly poor.In the wake of this mismanagement, the devotees have been waiting for more than 20 hours in long queues. Usually we hear Swamy Saranam Ayyappa Nama japam in the queue lines but due to heavy rush and poor management pilgrims were chanting down down police and CM.Yesterday was worst day in life.

Sharing the video of an injured Ayyappa devotee, BJP state president K Annamalai condemned the incident.

"12 December, 2023 ",First-time MLA and four-time state General Secretary Bhajan Lal Sharma: BJP signals organisational importance in choosing new CM for Rajasthan,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-rajasthan-general-secretary-bhajan-lal-sharma-cm/,"He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), contrary to the media speculations, announced Bhajan Lal Sharma as the CM-designate of Rajasthan. Further, his appointment is seen as a major deviation from the general political trend. Usually, seniority and political growth had been adjudged by the number of times a leader has been elected to the state assembly or Lok Sabha. 56-year-old Bhajan Lal Sharma is a first-time MLA. He completed his MA (politics) from Rajasthan University, Jaipur, in 1993.He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The BJP had fielded him after denying a ticket to the sitting MLA Ashok Lahoti. However, Sharma, a resident of Bharatpur, is said to have a strong hold on organisational politics. Before plunging into electoral politics, he had been working in the organisation for a long time. Bhajan Lal Sharma has been playing an important part in BJP’s organisational structure in Rajasthan. He has served as the state general secretary for the Bharatiya Janata Party four times. Previously, he had been associated with RSS and ABVP. For this reason, he is considered close to the party’s ideological mentor RSS, and party chief JP Nadda.The three major announcements on three consecutive days have signalled that the organisational importance played a major role in these major selections. A key similarity in these decisions has been the history of these leaders in serving various organisational roles and strengthening the party’s cadre in these states. Apart from Sharma, Dr. Mohan Yadav, the new CM-designate of Madhya Pradesh had held several organisational posts in BJP and its ideological mentor RSS. Yadav, who started student politics at Madhav Science College, and held many positions in the party. In 1982, he was the co-secretary of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union and in 1984, he was the President of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union.Mohan Yadav assumed the responsibility of Municipal Minister of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Ujjain) in the year 1984 and Department Head in 1986. In the year 1988, Yadav was the state co-secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Madhya Pradesh) and a member of the national executive. He was the State Minister of the State Unit of the Council in 1989-90 and the National Minister of the Council in the year 1991-92. In 1993-95, he served as the functionary (Sangh Karyavah) of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Ujjain Nagar. Additionally, his appointment was also seen as a major signal of political empowerment for the Yadav community, a dominant political force in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, however, have lacked proper proportional representation owing to the family-oriented politics of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD). Similarly, Vishnu Deo Sai, the next CM-designate of Chhattisgarh held the top organisational post in BJP’s Chhattisgarh unit. He served as Chhattisgarh BJP President from 2006 to 2013. His appointment also signalled a strong empowerment for the tribal community which was earlier witnessed when BJP-led NDA picked Droupadi Murmu for the Presidential post.   With all these new appointments, BJP signals that its motto ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’ (inclusivity) will be counter to the opposition’s push for caste census and proportional representation. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","As TV reporters shamelessly fight for smoke canister thrown in Parliament, here are a few things we should all be worried about after witnessing...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-fight-colour-canister-parliament-few-things-we-should-be-worried-about/,"If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai who admitted that they were like vultures. On the 13th of December 2023, there was a serious security breach in the Parliament of India. Two individuals hurled a smoke canister from the viewer gallery. They then jumped to the floor of the house and were trying to make their way towards the speaker when were overpowered by parliamentarians. Thereafter they were detained by the police and taken for interrogation. Just as the security breach took place, there were two individuals outside the parliament protesting with similar colour smoke canisters. According to preliminary information from the Delhi Police, there is no terror angle to the incidents, however, the police are taking the breach seriously. According to reports, the intruder inside the parliament was chanting slogans about “Kaala Kanoon” and the protestors outside the Parliament were chanting slogans like Jai Bhim, Tanashahi Nahi Chalegi, Manipur ko Insaf do, etc. While the country was shocked by the serious security breach and the ramifications of the lapse, Indian media was conducting their very own circus. A video emerged where TV journalists were seen fighting like animals over the smoke canister that was hurled by the protestors. In the video put out by TV9, their journalist was showing the smoke canister on camera. While he was doing his segment, other journalists started trying to snatch the canister saying that he had used it enough and should hand over the canister to other journalists. When the other journalists started trying to snatch the canister, the TV9 journalist was seen almost sprinting with it, trying to get a few more seconds with the canister – for the sake of the hard-hitting coverage of the unfolding incident at the Parliament. As the nation had important questions that the media should have been focussing on – like how this security breach took place, who were the intruders, what were they chanting, why they did what they did, what was the police doing and how visitors entered the parliament with canisters and why were the Delhi Police so lackadaisical in arrested the protestors outside the Parliament, almost looking like they were taking them for a walk, these elements in the media seemed far more interested in ridiculous sensationalism and showing visuals of the canister. While we watched this circus unfold, there are several important aspects that people need to be extremely worried about. First and foremost, one has to wonder about the priorities of the media and what they choose to cover when important events unfold. As mentioned, there are very important questions that need to be answered as this security breach unfolds. The Parliament is not just a building but a symbol of the democracy of India and the seat of power. Any attack on the Parliament is an attack on democracy and the sovereignty of India itself. While these events unfolded, the journalists on the ground should have been far more focused on bringing crucial details to the people of the nation. And while several journalists were doing so, some were indulging in cheap sensationalism. This, however, comes as no surprise. One is reminded of the time when Rajdeep Sardesai was talking about the 2001 Parliament Attack – the terrorist attack that incidentally took place on this day 22 years ago. In 2018, a video had gone viral where Rajdeep Sardesai admitted that journalists were vultures. Sardesai in the video recounted the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament where he and his crew were preparing for a picnic owing to a slow news day. Preparing for a feast in the garden near the Parliament, he and his team entered the Parliament at around 11 am. Within minutes of the team entering the Parliament, he says they heard gunshots. The Parliament was attacked. He then recalled that when his colleague asked him to leave, he directed him to suggest the guard to close the gates. He explained with a wide grin that he did so so that no other channel crew could enter. Those days there were fewer channels and Sardesai was excited at the prospect of doing an exclusive story.He then says how the exclusive story of the parliament attack made the team forget the wine and kababs they were planning to picnic on. “It was a great day. We are like vultures. We feed on these moments.” he added.If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran vultures like Rajdeep Sardesai. While the conduct of the media was abysmal, what is far more concerning is the conduct of the Delhi Police and security agencies. When a security breach like this has taken place, one would imagine that the police and law enforcement agencies would ask the media to stand back – after all, 26/11 was a classic case of how the media could potentially jeopardise any rescue operation and investigation when such incidents take place. During the Mumbai Attack, the police allowed unbridled access to the media, resulting in journalists like Barkha Dutt potentially giving away crucial information on hostages from ISI handlers who were closely monitoring the media. Taking a lesson from the past, the police should have summarily kept the media away. That canister itself could be crucial evidence that the police need, instead, the media was yet again given unbridled access to play with the canister as if were some sort of a prop in a drama. On the 22nd anniversary of the ghastly 2001 Parliament attack, the parliament was under severe threat. There were Khalistani and other terror organisations which had issued threats against the Parliament. While now the police are claiming that the smoke was not harmful, while the breach was ongoing, the police had to function under the assumption that it could be a deadly terror attack which could have dire ramifications. Despite that, the media was given unbridled access knowing fully well that such media has a history of creating a circus during serious incidents. Several other questions are being raised against the police as the Parliament’s security was breached. Visitors to the Parliament are frisked at every stage and there are now questions being asked as to how the security could have been so wanting that two individuals with smoke canisters could enter the Parliament. Per protocol, those who have passes to view the Parliament proceedings are not allowed to carry a paper inside the Parliament. Legitimate concerns are now being raised as to how, amid such tight security, two individuals could enter with these canisters. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ","Antisemitism is not new to US campuses including Ivy Leagues, their credibility is questionable for more reasons than one. Here’s why",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/antisemitism-not-new-to-us-campuses-their-credibility-questionable/,"While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A mix of Georgian and Victorian-era inspired academic buildings are spread across the Northeastern United States. Besides the entitled exclusivity in the admissions process, the unreasonable fee structure and the decorated syllabus, there is also a sadistic appeal to the Gothic appearance these institutions boast of.But, to quote Shakespeare, all that glitters is not gold.The holier-than-thou attitude over the decades of US’s Ivy Leagues – touted as the world’s most esteemed and prestigious universities – was brought to its knees when presidents of two of the three universities, Harvard and Penn, and the third being the high-ranking MIT, refused to condemn calls for genocide of Jews at a congressional hearing on 5th December.On 5th December, a congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” was held in Washington, D.C.At the hearing, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Her specific yes or no question to them was, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s rules or code of conduct regarding bullying or harassment?”MIT President Sally Kornbluth responded saying that “if targeted at individuals and not making public statements”. When asked for a yes or no answer, Kornbluth said that she has not heard calls for the genocide of Jews on MIT campus.The Congresswoman questioned, “But you have chants for intifada?” To this, Kornbluth replied, “I have heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.”She said that such calls would be investigated as harassment only “if pervasive and severe”.President (now former) of University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill’s response came with wide smiles and smirks. She said, “If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes.”When questioned again, Magill said that if such speech is directed and severe and pervasive, it is harassment. When asked if she means a yes, Magill said it is a context-dependent decision.She maintained that “if the speech becomes conduct, it is harassment”. Magill finally responded with a yes after much struggle. President of Harvard, Dr Claudine Gay reiterated the same chorus in answer to the question.“It (the call for genocide of Jews) can be (violate rules) depending on the context,” Dr Gay said. When asked what the context is she said, “targeted as an individual, targeted at an individual.”“Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, it amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action,” Dr Gay said.The roughly 3 minute 31 second long video of the hearing took social media by the storm prompting angry responses from netizens. The matter has escalated with key stakeholders demanding accountability from the presidents of the respective universities.President Liz Magill of University of Penn has resigned amid mounting pressure.The focus of the hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce was the rise in cases of antisemitism reported on campuses across the US and the universities’ response to the same.This comes in the backdrop of the 7th October terrorist attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel killing at least 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200 to Gaza. Israel has since vowed to avenge the death of its people and has launched an all-out offensive against the terrorist group.A selective support for Palestinians toeing the Hamas line has since mushroomed in campuses across the United States. In the name of human rights of Palestinians, the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel has been justified on the campuses of these so-called prestigious institutions with absolutely no repercussions from the administration.On 11th October, four days after the brutal attack on Israel, a group of Harvard students submitted a letter in support of Palestine. This prompted several corporate institutions, particularly those with Jewish heads, warning Harvard that they will not hire students supporting Hamas. Several Jewish donors to the universities also threatened to withdraw their donations.On 25th October, Jewish students at Cooper Union college in New York had to be locked inside library for their own safety as pro-Palestinian students tried to break down the door chanting “Free Palestine”. The Jewish students had to be escorted out through tunnels using the back door.On 18th October, a “Stop the genocide in Gaza” die-in demonstration was reportedly organised by the Harvard Business School. A video from the demonstration showed a Jewish student mobbed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators screaming “shame, shame, shame”.On 24th October, an antisemitic slogan was displayed on the wall of the library of George Washington University. It read, “Free Palestine From The River To The Sea.” Another message read, “Glory to our martyrs” and one read, “End the siege on Gaza”.While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A complaint letter via e-mail by the Jewish rights group ‘Brandeis Center’ to the University of Pennsylvania alleged that the latter had allowed its campus to become a hostile environment for Jewish students and a magnet for antisemites.It pointed to a festival that was organised by the university titled “Palestine Writes Festival” which hosted antisemitic speakers. Notably, this festival came days before the terrorist attacks proving the antisemitism is pre-existing sentiment on campuses in the US.The letter read, “In the days leading up to the September Festival, anti-Semitic graffiti and a Penn student’s violent attack on Penn’s Hillel signaled trouble to come for Jewish students and institutions on campus.”Surprisingly, the festival was organised on the same day as the Jewish festival ‘Jewish High Holy Days of Awe”. Meanwhile, Magill, despite concerns raised by several members, stood by the event citing “free speech”.Even now, as recently as 9th December (Saturday), Jewish students in the Penn University are being subjected to chants like “We are Hamas” whereas openly antisemitic professors and staff are still employed with the university.Forget even the recent decades, antisemitism on US campuses goes back nearly a century. In the 1950s, Stanford University reportedly tried to limit the proportion of its Jewish students.Stanford University is located on the West Coast of the US and is not an Ivy League university but ranks higher than Ivy League varsities.Another report reveals that the Seth Low Junior College (SLJC) near the Columbia University was “created with the explicit goal of reducing the amount of Jewish students on the CU campus”. It was built in the early 20th century.As per the report, the “enrollment of Jewish students at Columbia College after Seth Low Junior College’s opening dropped from 40 to 25 per cent”. Moreover, on one hand, half of the total Columbia College applicants were accepted, only one in six Jewish applicants were admitted in the early 20th century.This was reportedly the case in most East Coast schools in the US.One might think that on-campus antisemitism is an elephantine problem which dwarfs any other controversies surrounding academic campuses in America.Not really. The political invasion of campuses in America which is being exposed with hatred for Jews and Israel has only compounded their already declining credibility.The larger-than-life projected image of these institutions in the US has been a facade which has been maintained through endowments, donations and charities flowing in like dirt, open political biases, crippling admissions fees thereby giving academic access to only a handful, racial and gender persecution, and woke agendas.You’d be surprised, if not shocked, to know that it was only in June this year that the US Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer determine race as grounds for admissions.Up till the US SC verdict, race was still very much a part of the admissions process in the United States centered around the idea of “positive discrimination”.And yet, the move was decried by the left-liberal media in the US as the end of “affirmative action”.Racism has been rampant, like a regular petty crime, on US campuses including the so-called esteemed campuses. This has only served to fan left wing politics in the US where voices are raised prominently when incidents involve a black victim.But when Asian or Indian students are subjected to racism, the same woke left wing crowd goes into hiding. Safe to say, US campuses are not merely dealing with crimes of unabated racism but several politicised versions of it.In 2020, Princeton University had acknowledged that systemic racism exists on its campus following which an investigation was launched by the Trump administration.Columbia University graduate Emma Sulkowicz made headlines in 2015 by staging a protest based on performance art against alleged sexual harassment.Sulkowicz walked around the campus carrying a 50-pound mattress and across the stage during her graduation to symbolise the weight carried around by victims of sexual assault.She had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a classmate of rape during her sophomore year in 2013. The accused was cleared of the charges following a hearing by the university.In 2017, three professors in Dartmouth’s department of psychological and brain sciences were accused of sexual abuse and misconduct. The professors reportedly resigned or retired following recommendations for dismissal.However, the seven women who levelled the charges alleged that the college had failed to protect its students from sexual harassment and sexual assault.A scandal broke out in Cornell University last year exposing alleged incidents of sexual assault and druggings at off-campus fraternity parties. A crime alert was issued early in November 2022 by the campus police responding to four different reports of students being drugged and at least once case of sexual assault.In May 2022, a longtime professor at Princeton named Joshua Katz was suspended after investigation revealed that he had sex with one of his undergraduate students years ago.In 2021, several complaints surfaced against the professor from mid-2000s alleging disturbing cases of allegedly propositioning undergraduates for sexual relationships.In 1986, a shocking scandal was uncovered in Brown University wherein students were allegedly linked to a sex worker ring in Providence. Multiple students were charged with sex work crimes and drug possession.According to The Washington Post, Harvard in 2022 warned all undergraduate students that “cisheterosexism,” “fatphobia” and “using the wrong pronouns” amounted to “abuse” and perpetuated “violence” on campus.In May this year, the student government at the Northwestern University in Illinois “indefinitely” froze the funds of the College Republicans over an event poster showing conservative speaker James Lindsay, critical of transgenderism.After an uproar that has been dragging in the US over participation of trans athletes in women’s sports, a bill was approved by the House Republicans in April this year barring such transgender athletes whose biological sex awas assigned at birth as male from competing on girls’ or women’s sports teams.As if the use of a thousand pronouns for individually-preferred “gender” identification has not disadvantaged academically-focused students enough, transgenders participating against females in sports has most definitely put the latter at a physical disadvantage.High-profile names involving celebrities and politicians and their aides were at the center of a massive admissions scandal across universities.College athletics coaches and test administrators accepted bribes and donations in exchange for recruiting students. The mastermind, William Rick Singer, was paid a whopping $25 million by celebrity parents to bribe coaches and university administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits to facilitate their admission.Singer allegedly created fake charities to facilitate money for “donations” to various colleges including Yale University, Georgetown, Stanford and the University of Southern California.The big names involved in the scandal include Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman, Mossimo Giannulli, William H Macy, Michelle Janavs and many more. One of the more prominent names is Gordon Ernst, former Georgetown University tennis coach known for having coached the Obamas.In 2022, a professor at Columbia University, Michael Thaddeus, published a paper accusing the varsity of manipulating data to project that it spent more on research and instruction than it actually did.This, reportedly, in turn is suspected to have played a role in the Ivy League institution’s jump in the rankings. The university later admitted that they had reported incorrect data but refused to admit that it was done to improve rankings.As per the professor’s report, the varsity’s rankings moved up from no. 18 in 1988 to no 2 by 2022. Following the controversy, Columbia, Yale and Harvard announced that they would no longer participate in the rankings in the future.The rise of wokeism on university campuses in US can easily be attributed to left-wing bias. In fact, it can be considered a branch of the same tree.According to a poll, Republicans have the least amount of confidence (19%) in higher education in the United States whereas Democrats have the highest level of confidence at 59%.Another related survey reportedly found that 77% of college presidents in the US agree that the perception of colleges as intolerant of conservative views has impacted people’s attitudes about higher education.According to a report, US universities have been receiving funding from Qatar particularly in the period between 2001 and 2021, “precisely after the September 11 attacks”.As per the report based on a study published in 2022, a staggering $4.7 billion was injected into universities in the United States. Moreover, the recipients did not report part of the money received as required by the law.“Qatar has reportedly become the largest foreign donor to American academic in the two decades since 9/11,” the report reads.In 2020, the Trump administration alleged that top US universities have “massively underreported” foreign funding from China, Russia and other nations described as “foreign adversaries”.According to another report, Saudi Arabia owned oil company ARAMCO has been funding programmes in US universities like Princeton since as early as the 1950s. Moreover, Middle East studies programme in US institutions reportedly receive specifically from Arab countries to “advance their political agendas”.“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the Saudis have seen such donations as a way to acquire goodwill, legitimacy and support in U.S. academia,” the report quotes NYU professor Zachary Lockman. Interestingly, it must be noted that some of the biggest names like George Soros and the Rothschilds, which bestow donations in billions to the US acadmia, are Jewish. And it is thus a wonder as to how these institutions, funded equally well by the left-liberal globalist disruptors like their Middle Eastern counterparts, have been unable to counter antisemitism. Yet, when questions are raised against these conglomerates, they coin the term antisemitism through their rights groups and NGOs in their defence.All in all, Universities in the US are too good to be true for their realities have been exposed for all to see since a long time. It is time to stop trusting every colonial infrastructure just because they put on a good show of elitist exclusivity. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"7 December, 2023 ","How The Hindu consoled itself and shielded Rahul Gandhi after electoral drubbing in 3 states: Blaming regional leaders, voters, Hindutva and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/the-hindu-shields-rahul-gandhi-electoral-loss-3-states-regional-leaders-voters-hindutva/,"The Gandhi family must realise how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is praiseworthy! By now, we are all used to the Congress party leaders crediting the Gandhi family for victories and blaming the regional leaders for their defeats. It is understandable why they are forced to do this. However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources. We need your support to fight them.

"6 December, 2023 ",31 years of Babri demolition: Remembering the Karsevaks who razed the face of adharma to the ground to pave the way for a Bhavya...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/babri-demolition-by-karsevaks-paved-the-way-for-ram-mandir-temple-in-ayodhya/,"While centuries of struggle to reclaim Dharma culminated in November 2019 when the Supreme Court of India handed over the encroached land in Ayodhya to Hindus, paving the way for the construction of a Bhavya Ram Mandir, the events that transpired on 6 December 1992 hold profound significance, for it manifested in the starkest form the passions and devotion of Karsevaks in wanting to liberate the birthplace of Lord Rama. Saryu Mata (the Holy river in Ayodhya) bears witness to the events and incidents of Ramayana in the Treta Yug to the reclamation of the Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in the present day. She was the source for Bhagwan Ram, a reincarnation of Bhagwan Vishnu, and his devotees in Ayodhya to return to Vishnu Ji’s abode Vaikunth Dham.On 2nd November 1990, once again, albeit in shocking circumstances, the souls of Shri Ram’s devotees departed for Vaikunth right from the banks of Saryu. The Mulayam Singh-led UP Police had opened fire on a large group of kar sevaks who had come to Ayodhya to demand that the Babri structure be demolished and Ram Mandir be reconstructed.The Kothari brothers – Ram (23) and Sharad (20) Kothari – were the first ones to mount a Saffron flag atop the Babri controversial structure. A report filed on 3rd November 1990 in Jansatta said that an unidentified kar sevak from Sriganganagar, Rajasthan fell after being shot and as he fell, he wrote “Sitaram” on the road with his blood.It remains a mystery whether the Karsevak had written his name or was his devotion and adherence towards Lord Ram that made him write “Sitaram” in his own blood.The report mentioned that even after Karsevak fell to the ground, the CRPF personnel shot seven bullets into his skull.As per official figures, 16 kar sevaks were killed in cold blood. But actual numbers are believed to be much higher. Their only crime was that they staged peaceful demonstrations by expressing their religious reverence and singing bhajans.Little did they know that their act would send a wave across the country that would come right back to hit that very spot on 6th December 1992 for nothing and no one could soil the spirit of Ram Bhakts. 25 months later, on 6th December 1992, Hindus reminded the world once again that they hadn’t remotely been deterred in their fight for divine justice.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad organised a kar seva in Ayodhya in 1992 and an area was marked for worship on 6th December. Kar sevaks from across the country began to pour into Ayodhya in large numbers even as security personnel were deployed in equally large numbers.According to Mahant Brajmohan Das, who witnessed the demolition of the Babri structure on 6th December 1992, the birthplace of Shri Ram was filled with joy and enthusiasm. “Only those who were present in Ayodhya on that day can explain what God’s miracles and powers are,” he said.All arrangements including food, accommodation et cetera were made for thousands of devotees. “There seemed to be complete Ram Rajya in Ayodhya,” he said. Despite what ensued in 1990, the number of karsevaks visiting Ayodhya in 1992 and security personnel deployed was so large that the Mahant said that if the massacre was repeated, no one would come out alive.Finally, on 6th December 1992, a kar sevak entered an empty bus belonging to the security forces near Hanumangarhi and raced it towards the Babri structure shattering all barricades and paving the way for kar sevaks who followed.Call it divine intervention, the symbol of tyranny, savagery and bigotry was razed to dust that day; this formed the cornerstone of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Kar sevaks cut the barbed wire barricading the Babri structure and climbed atop it.The three worn-out tombs of the Babri structure were brought down in less than 6 hours amid Holy chants of Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram. This was the first line of treatment for the wounded Hindu civilisation, all thanks and namans (bowing down) to the kar sevaks who risked their lives once again.Documentaries were made by the mainstream media to blot the image of kar sevaks, nat up sounds of Jai Shri Ram were played by the ecosystem of the day to push a narrative to demonise the Holy chant.Even as the Hindus, the kar sevaks removed the Babri structure from the face of the earth – as should be the case with every symbol of adharma (roughly translating to injustice) – we paid the price for it in the war of narratives that were to come.Hindus displayed to the world that when justice is delayed and denied when a civilisation seeking justice is brutalised and demonised, we will come to our own defence.Come to think of it, our patience knows no bounds but when we are pushed to the edge and tested, we end adharma once and for all – be it slaying Ravan in Treta Yug, demolishing Babur’s Babri structure in 1992 or bulldozing the mafia to the ground today.31 years on, every year on this day a certain ecosystem mourns the physical death of Babri structure while the civilisational wounds of a devout Hindu continue to be healed. On 22nd January 2024, Ram Lalla’s Pran Pratishtha will be performed and He will finally be resting comfortably watching over us from His Bhavya Mandir.On 6th December 2023, we must remember and celebrate the men and women across the nation who enabled this movement and reignited hope in Hindus. They taught us that bullets and barricades can’t kill our souls. We must dare to demolish injustice to the ground every time it pops its ugly face and pave the way for justice.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 November, 2023 ","No, Shakib Al Hasan wasn’t beaten up on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup: Here’s the truth about the viral video",https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/shakib-al-hasan-wasnt-beaten-up-on-his-return-to-bangladesh-after-world-cup-truth-about-the-viral-video/,"An old video of Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib Al-Hasan being beaten up and shoved around is going viral on social media with the claim that the all-rounder had been pushed around on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup. In the wake of Bangladesh’s poor performance in the World Cup 2023, a video of Shakib Al Hasan being pulled, and thrashed by a mob is going viral on the internet. It is being claimed that the Bangladeshi Captain Shakib was mobbed by angry Bangladeshi fans on his return to the country. The viral video was also shared by some media portals claiming that the Bangladeshi skipper was ‘brutally beaten’/ ‘assaulted’ after the team’s World Cup debacle.  Kalesh b/w Bangladeshi Fans and Shakib al hasan, when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign  pic.twitter.com/C7DQK93gAkThis happened to Shakib when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign Bangladeshi people are top tier ret@rds https://t.co/iFDogEkZCA pic.twitter.com/xKkkyfmLFRJournalist Anil Tiwari who writes for Qatari mouthpiece Aljazeera, as per his Twitter bio, tweeted, “Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India’s defeat. Utterly disgraceful behaviour.”Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India's defeat. Utterly disgraceful behavior. #CricketWorldCup #Cricket #Bangladesh  pic.twitter.com/bYY9Cn6xBSHere are some headlines from media portals making those claims alongside sharing the viral video. A Cricket portal named OneCricket headlined (Archive) “[Watch] Shakib Al Hasan Gets ‘Brutally Beaten’ By Bangladesh Fans After Horrific World Cup Run”Notably, Bangladesh performed badly and finished in the eighth spot in the recently concluded World Cup, falling way below the fans’ expectations. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side only managed to win 2 games and the skipper himself had an unforgettable outing. He had to bench himself in some games due to injury concerns. However, the claims being made on the basis of the viral videos are fake. The video doing rounds on the internet is an old video. The said incident involving Shakib Al Hasan captured in the video took place in March this year, that is the video is 8 months old. It is not linked with Bangladesh’s poor performance at the World Cup or Shakib’s below-per-performance. Additionally, the Bangladeshi skipper was not assaulted or mobbed on his return to the country after the team’s World Cup debacle, as claimed on the internet.  The incident took place in Dubai on 16th March when Shakib Al Hasan went for a commercial event at a Jewelry store. After his series against England in March this year, Shakib flew to Dubai to inaugurate a gold jewelry shop that was owned by Arav Khan. Khan is a Bangladeshi fugitive and wanted in the murder case of a police official.At the time of the incident, Shakib was surrounded by fans who went out of control and he tried to rush out. However, in the chaos, he almost fell over while fans kept pulling his collar to stop him and take selfies with him. As seen from the video and confirmed by media reports of that time, he had no security around him to keep fans in check.   Regarding the Dubai incident involving Shakib, the Additional commissioner (detective) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) told the media that the man (Robiul Islam) who uploaded the video is from Bangladesh. The Police official added that Islam had murdered a police officer and had taken an Indian passport. He noted that the accused then went on to live in Dubai and despite knowing his criminal past Shakib went to his event. It is important to note here that Arav Khan’s original name is Robiul Islam. He hails from Kotalipara in Gopalganj and fled the country after charges of murder.The officer added that as part of the investigation, the Bangladeshi Cricket team’s captain might also be quizzed. Sharing reports and details of the original incident, several Twitter users called out the fake claims being made about Shakib Al Hasan. The users slammed individuals and media outlets for peddling these false claims, particularly those who connected the recent setback for Bangladesh with an older video depicting fans pulling his shirt, falsely portraying it as a case of him being manhandled or assaulted while attempting to take a selfie. This footage from Dubai in purposes of business and the audio was taken from a tv DramaOld news pic.twitter.com/NTb3uviioDFAKE NEWS BUSTED !! #ShakibAlHasanhttps://t.co/W7lwtlO2TaI hope you recover from the hated of your own bitrthland.Fake voice alertThis is a 8 months old video from dubai.where he went for promotion and fans wanted to take it photo with him.Crowd went out of control.Such a disgusting thing that it is morphed by a Bangladeshi Kohli fan pic.twitter.com/89qzTQvfsfSome users accused that the fake claims were peddled by Kohli fans in Bangladesh.

"18 November, 2023 ",Madhya Pradesh: Political fight between two groups in Jabalpur portrayed online as an attack on Sikhs,https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/madhya-pradesh-jabalpur-sikh-man-beaten-poltiical-fight-given-communal-angle-fact-check/,"The scuffle took place between a politician (the Sikh man seen in the video) and members of the opposite political party during the Vidhan Sabha polling in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. On Friday (17th November), a video of a confrontation between two groups was falsely presented as a hate crime against the Sikh community by a Hindu mob.The incident reportedly took place in Jabalpur city of Madhya Pradesh. A Sikh man in a scooter was assaulted by a group of men, the video of which went viral on social media.Prominent fake news peddlers attempted to give a communal spin to the incident. “Sikh was attacked by a Hindu mob…Nobody is safe under BJP ruled government unless he is a BJP supporter,” claimed Islamist X handle ‘RheA’.Another Islamist claimed, “First Muslim, then Dalit and now Sikh.”“Madhya Pradesh – Sikh attacked by Hindu mob in Jabalpur. While raising religious slogans, people badly beat up a person from the Sikh community,” tweeted one ‘mdirfan997’.Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) also amplified the incident and asked the Madhya Pradesh Police to take action.SGPC President Harjinder Singh Dhami has taken notice of a viral video from Jabalpur, in which, a Sikh is seen being assaulted by some men. He said that such an incident of assault with insult to Sikh turban and Kes (unshorn hair) is highly unfortunate and strongly condemnable.… https://t.co/HAVPR9P1D5Contrary to claims on social media, the scuffle took place between a politician (the Sikh man seen in the video) and members of the opposite political party during Vidhan Sabha polling in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. There was no ‘communal angle’ in the incident.Secretary of the Vidarbha Taxpayers Association (VTA), Tejinder Singh Renu, informed, “A video circulated widely on social media (screenshots shared) is from Jabalpur; but it has nothing to do with #Hindu #Sikh enmity.”“Yesterday there were elections in Madhya Pradesh and this incident happened in the Madan Mahal area. The Sikh man being thrashed is a political leader of the area and the men beating him mercilessly are from another political party,” he added.A video circulated widely on social media (screenshots shared) is from Jabalpur; but it has nothing to do with #Hindu #Sikh enmity.Yesterday there were elections in Madhya Pradesh and this incident happened in the Madan Mahal area.

"12 December, 2023 ","Did Washington Post repeat Pakistani conspiracy theory about ‘Disinfo Lab’? Copy-paste journalism, reliance on lunatic who wanted Mamata Banerjee raped, claims about ‘SkinDoctor’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-disinfo-lab-article-on-pakistani-conspiracy-theory/,"Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Aveek Sen's misleading tweets on 'Disinfo Lab' became the primary fodder for both 'Pakistani Defence' and 'The Washington Post'.A day after The Washington Post carried out a hit job on Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, it has come to light that some of the outlandish claims made by the American newspaper bear an uncanny resemblance to conspiracy theories peddled by a Pakistani website.In an attempt to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’, The Washington Post claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.Although it relied on word salad, insinuations, ‘source-based’ allegations and dubious ‘experts’, the American newspaper failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of ‘Disinfo Lab.’Interestingly, a large part of the purported ‘investigation’ by The Washington Post on the Indian OSINT handle appears to be based on conspiracy theories peddled by a website named ‘Pakistan Defence.’In an article titled ‘Disinfo Lab – A Disinformation Project of Indian RA&W’, published by the website in February 2022, a staff writer Amaa’n relied on outlandish claims made by ‘journalist’ Aveek Sen to draw links between ‘Disinfo Lab’ and Indian Intelligence.The ‘Pakistan Defence’ article made references to Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy, Ajayendra Tripathi, and BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga – all of whom appear prominently in the propaganda piece of The Washington Post.The Pakistani website presented the accusations of Aveek Sen, an abusive troll, as the ‘gospel truth.’ In the tweet from 2013 that went viral, Aveek Sen was seen quoting TimesNow, saying that Mamata Banerjee had called the Barasat rapists ‘CPIM supporters’. To that, Aveek Sen had responded saying “Its high time these cpm supporters rape Mamata!”Prior to deleting his account, Aveek Sen had made several dergatory comments targeting women. A few of his archived misogynist tweets can be seen here – In several of his tweets, Aveek Sen was seen referring to women as ‘prostitutes.’Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Sen’s misleading tweets on ‘Disinfo Lab’ became the primary fodder for both ‘Pakistani Defence’ and ‘The Washington Post’. Interestingly, he had also collaborated with the likes of propaganda outlets such as Newslaundry.“And the making of Indian fake disinfo lab, copying the famous eu disinfo lab that exposed hundreds and thousands of fake Indian websites (By author Aveek sen),” read a line from the article on ‘Pakistan Defence.’Coincidentally, a similar language is used in the report published by The Washington Post. “Another person, a former employee, said the Disinfo Lab named and modelled itself after groups such as the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that researches disinformation targeting Europe,” it claimed.It claimed, “Some of the fronts, setup by Colonel Dibya Satpathy, per Aveek Sen’s revelation, include: Root N Wings Media, situated at B-3, Bali’s, Near BSES Office, Arya Samaj Mandir, Lajpat Nagar 2, Delhi. Flat A-20, Lajpat Nagar 3, near Ring Road, Delhi.”Interestingly, the claims made it to the report of The Washington Post as well. “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors working out of a four-story whitewashed building on a leafy street in New Delhi,” the leftist newspaper wrote.In another paragraph, it said, “The office operated under the name Root and Wings Media.” Based on Aveek Sen’s tweets, the shady Pakistani website alleged that Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy had been campaigning against the country on the behest of R&AW and BJP.OpIndia found yet another uncanny resemblance in the report of The Washington Post where it said, “The Disinfo Lab itself was headed by Satpathy, whose work has focused mostly on countering Pakistan.”“The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” the American newspaper claimed in another part of the article.Both The Washington Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ made specific references to ‘Root Wings Media’ and characterised it as a ‘social media marketing company/ campaign agency.’“The company has no more than ten employees, typical of an intelligence front,” the Pakistani website said. And this is what the American newspaper claimed – “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors.” Both The Washingon Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ targeted targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.“Some of the investigative reports published by this website include one aiming to discredit the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,” wrote ‘Pakistan Defence.’“The Disinfo Lab often cites publicly available U.S. lobbying and campaign finance records and produces complex flowcharts to illustrate alleged relationships. But the group draws tenuous connections, claiming, for instance, that a USCIRF commissioner was influenced by Islamists because she once worked on a conservative fundraising committee alongside a lobbyist who went on to represent Muslim American groups,” claimed The Washington Post.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.The Washington Post ensured to not include all conspiracy theories to set its ‘investigative article’ apart from that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ The Pakistani website had even dubbed popular member and dermatologist Neelam Singh aka ‘The Skin Doctor’ as an aide to R&AW officer Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy.“The Evil nexus of Col Dibya Satpathy Indian ex-military intelligence officer and bjp troll farms. To (sic) manufacture and spread propaganda and misinformation with the help of Major Neelam “Neel” Kumari alias “The Skin Doctor”, Major Gaurav Arya,” it claimed.‘Pakistan Defence’ accused ‘The Skin Doctor’ of carrying out the ‘evil nexus’ of supposed ‘Disinfo Lab’ founder and Indian Intelligence officerThe Washington Post did not copy-paste the outrageous claims about ‘Disinfo Lab’ only from ‘Pakistan Defence’ but another Pakistani-based website named ‘Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research (CSCR).Interestingly, CSCR published another misleading piece on ‘Disinfo Lab’ a year before that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ Habitual fake news peddler and anti-Hindu activist CJ Werleman had made similar insinuations about the Indian OSINT handle in February last year.First, the claim of our association with Govt agencies/ RAW. The report is essentially a recycle of previous reports published by Pakistani ISPR/ Info-war machinery. The report is periodically recycled, last by known fake news peddler CJ Werleman.Lazy Journalism!(2/n) pic.twitter.com/0oXNGfrVyoIn November 2021, CJ Werleman had appealed to boycott Indian products to supposedly ‘save’ Muslims in India and Kashmir. Before that, he had tweeted a video of Pramod Muthalik, the chief of the Hindu activist group Shri Rama Sene, to allege that he called for violence against Muslims and the demolition of a mosque in Karnataka. Earlier, he claimed Indians had destroyed a Muslim graveyard in Himachal Pradesh, which was also fake news. In August 2021 when the Islamist group Taliban took over Afghanistan, Werleman was caught spreading Taliban propaganda. In September 2021, he called for ‘regime decapitation’ strikes against India.The Print, run by Shekhar Gupta had eulogised Werleman in a profile describing him as a ‘bigot-turned-crusader against ‘Islamophobia’ who is taking on the Indian state’. Since every anti-India propagandist is a potential source of The Washington Post, there will surely be no dearth of more anti-India hit pieces ahead of the 2024 elections.While hitting out at The Washington Post, ‘Disinfo Lab’ pointed out that the only difference in its article and past hitjobs against it is the addition of unnamed sources. “The only ‘upgrade’ the WaPo did was to make this Pakistani allegation ‘anonymous’. And whatever is in addition to that is again attributed to ‘anonymous’ sources. Hence, literally, every fact claimed is ‘anonymous’. The report has more than 10 anonymous sources,” it added.As pointed out earlier by OpIndia, The Washington Post failed to refute any assertions made by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ It also noted, “While, in their questions to us and other people, WaPo journalists have themselves noted that our claims are factually correct! (thanks for acknowledgement), they alleged that we make ‘tenuous claims’, and cited a few examples.”While calling out the bluff of the leftist newspaper, Disinfo Lab concluded that The Washington Post is overrated. “It is not surprising that people who don’t understand OSINT are baffled by our reporting. It is especially hard for legacy media journos – Indian and foreign alike, who have known journalism only as handouts from sources. Agencies are overrated. OSINT is underrated,” it emphasised.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"12 December, 2023 ",Washington Post and its hit job on ‘Disinfo Lab’: Exposing the nefarious campaign to discredit Indian OSINT handle before 2024 Lok Sabha election,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-hitjob-against-disinfo-lab-anti-india-propaganda-before-2024-elections/,"Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, The Washington Post has launched a campaign of sorts to de-legitimise those exposing anti-India narratives and promote individuals disseminating propaganda against India.On Sunday (10th December), the leftist media outlet carried out a hit job on the Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab.’ To this effect, it published an article titled ‘Covert Indian operation seeks to discredit Modi’s critics in the U.S.’The development comes two days after American political commentator Jack Posobiec revealed how The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Priyanshu Verma had been soliciting information about ‘Disinfo Lab.’‘Disinfo Lab’ is the same OSINT handle, which earlier exposed how the US State Department was relying on misleading data (sourced from Christian evangelist groups and radical Islamist outfits) to allege a decline in India’s religious freedom.It was thus obvious that US-based leftist media outlets such as The Washington Post would make attempts to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’ sooner or later. Based on ‘sources’, Pranshu Verma and his two other colleagues claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Intelligence Officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.The trio at The Washington Post alleged that the objective of ‘Disinfo Lab’ is to ‘research and discredit foreign critics of the Modi government’, ‘combine fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims’, ‘intimidate individuals overseas’ and ‘run covert influence operation.’However, a cursory look at the website of the OSINT handle reveals that it is focused on uncovering disinformation campaigns, aimed at tarnishing the image of India on a global scale. Nevertheless, this did not stop The Washington Post from making sweeping claims about it. “The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” it brazened out.The leftist media outlet roped in several ‘experts’ to suggest that the Indian government led by PM Narendra Modi is using an OSINT handle with 45.6K followers to undermine political rivals and create a global narrative.One such expert was an ‘academic’ named Joyjeet Pal. He claimed, “The Indian right wing is a new player that has arrived on the world stage and wants to shape global discussion…So far, much of it is done in the same way it’s done within India — through crude, blunt force. But it’s getting smarter.” The Washinton Post introduced Pal as a University of Michigan Professor ‘who studies disinformation in India.’ Interestingly, he is the same ‘expert’ whose obscure research was used by Indian leftist propaganda outlet The Wire to discredit calls for investigating the unnatural death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Claim: Raksha Mantri @rajnathsingh admitted on @CNNnews18 that Chinese soldiers crossed Indian side of LACFact: The Minister was referring to differing perceptions of LAC & presence of Chinese troops It is being misinterpreted as if Chinese troops entered Indian side of LAC pic.twitter.com/Xews6Ba1bqAnother controversial expert cited by The Washington Post in its report was ‘journalist’ Ajai Shukla. He claimed, “(The defence establishment) exists to serve national and strategic interests, not political interests. But the BJP under Modi has seen critics as anti-Indian, the enemies of India itself.”Shukla has a history of peddling fake news (here and here) in the context of the India-China border dispute. He had also disseminated conspiracy theories post the 2019 Pulwama terror attack and was dubbed sexist by a prominent Italian journalist. Despite such dwindling credibility, The Washington Post roped him as an expert for its propaganda-laden piece on ‘Disinfo Lab.’India has been under tremendous pressure to choose sides, following the Russia-Ukraine war. The US state apparatus and the media on several occasions had even threatened India with sanctions for purchasing oil from Russia, only to receive befitting replies from External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.Nevertheless, The Washington Post saw it as an opportunity to attack India’s neutral position in the ongoing crisis. “Coordinated social media accounts have been found to play a role, for instance, in spreading identical posts in support of Russia, an important supplier of weapons and energy to India…” it furthered the US State narrative.The leftist news outlet targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.Throughout its article, The Washington Post desperately tried to whitewash both anti-Hindu and anti-India activists and paint them as ‘victims’ of the social media exposé by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ One such activist mentioned by the leftist media outlet happens to be Pieter Friedrich, who has ties to Khalistani terrorist Bhajan Bhinder.“The organization released a dossier nearly 100 pages long alleging that Pieter Friedrich, a California-based activist and journalist who has written magazine articles and given public speeches critical of the BJP and affiliated Hindu-nationalist groups, had ties to the Sikh separatist movement and Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency. The Disinfo Lab burrowed into California state records to uncover Friedrich’s employment history, published his parents’ names and plotted detailed graphs about his social media activity,” it claimed.1) The days of people like Friedrich making threats against non-white people,especially because of the color of their skin, their religious affiliation, or their country of origin must remain behind us.In 2021, OpIndia reported how Pieter Friedrich evolved from a Christian zealot and a Gandhi basher to a ‘critic of Hindu fascism’ and a Khalistani asset. In June last year, he was slammed for allegedly giving death threats to a Hindu US Representative from Illinois, Raja Krishnamoorthi.The Washington Post lamented that ‘Disinfo Lab’, which posted a plethora of evidence tying ‘activist’ Sunita Vishwanath to far-left billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Foundations (OSF), was used against Congress scion Rahul Gandhi.“The Disinfo Lab dug into her past and reported that a nonprofit she launched to help female Afghan refugees had received funding from Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Two months later, after Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi attended a meeting in Washington with Viswanath as part of a U.S. tour, Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP’s social media team, tweeted a photo of the meeting and shared a flowchart stamped with the Disinfo Lab logo illustrating Viswanath’s connections to Soros,” wrote the leftist media outlet.Sunita Vishwanath is the co-founder of an organisation named ‘Women for Afghan Women’, which is funded by OSF. She is also the co-founder of ‘Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr)’ and has tried to create hysteria and panic among Indian Muslims about the National Register of Citizens (NRC).“We are especially appalled by the most recent nightmare of the Kashmiri people, and the situation of 1.9 million people in India who are rendered stateless due to the imposition of the travesty called the National Register of Citizens”, Vishwanath said in 2019. In September 2021, she also participated in the Hinduphobic conference ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva.’ The Washington Post also roped in the policy director of Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr), Ria Chakraborty, to make a case for an organisation named ‘Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC).’➡️IAMC's terror angleIAMC has close ties with terror organizations like SIMI, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-e-Islami.Infact, Mohammad Siddiqi, the founder of SIMI, was once hosted as a guest at IAMC.Research credit – @DisinfoLab pic.twitter.com/iufbOJy9gsAccording to the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), the Indian Americal Muslim Council has links [pdf] with the banned Islamic terror outfit, Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).Besides, the Indian American Muslim Council has ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) through its founder Shaik Ubaid. The IAMC is a Jamat-e-Islami-backed lobbyist organisation claiming to be a rights advocacy group.It had been caught spreading fake news to further the Islamist cause in India. It had also been slapped with the UAPA in 2021.The Washington Post also made references to anti-Brahmin activist Thenmozhi Soundarajan and her organisation ‘Equality Labs’. Soundarajan had shot to fame in 2018 after the then Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey clicked pictures with a poster, designed by her, carrying the tagline ‘Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy.’In April 2022, tech giant Google cancelled a talk by Thenmozhi Soundararajan, owing to the fear that it might create ‘division and rancour’ in the workplace. Google spokesperson Shannon Newberry had said, “We also made the decision to not move forward with the proposed talk which — rather than bringing our community together and raising awareness — was creating division and rancour.”In November last year, she went on an unhinged tirade against Yoga. During the one-and-a-half-hour-long podcast, Soundararajan cast aspersions on the history of the ancient Indian Hindu practice and claimed that it was used by Brahmins to oppress the Dalit community. She also insinuated that Yoga had an in-built system of hierarchy, which supposedly made it vulnerable to abuse.What does it mean to address the structural violence at the heart of yoga? I break the silence on the religious abuse that is at the heart of yoga and how healing begins with debrahminizing and decolonizing. Check it on the latest #conspirituality pod https://t.co/7OadWRA1EP pic.twitter.com/gWgEWCwIv7The Washington Post also attempted to whitewash far-left billionaire George Soros and his nefarious anti-India agenda.The leftist media outlet wrote, “In February, Soros, a frequent critic of Modi, warned in a speech at the Munich Security Conference that the Indian leader was undemocratic and would lose his “stranglehold” over the Indian government. A day later, the Disinfo Lab posted a lengthy tweet thread alleging that Soros had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and manipulated “fake” U.S.-based advocacy groups to smear India. A spokesperson for Soros’s Open Society Foundations called the Disinfo Lab’s claims “entirely baseless” and said they were part of a “campaign by this site and others in India against advocates of human rights, democratic governance and the rule of law in the service of the political aims of the BJP and its allies.”“India has been fighting a ‘perception war’ on all fronts since the start of 2023. On February 16 this year, George Soros exploited the Adani-Hindenburg controversy and launched a scathing attack on the Indian government.He claimed, “Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies. Their fate is intertwined…Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but it failed. Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards.”Soros accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of crony capitalism. “Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament,” he added.The Hungarian-American billionaire also said that the ‘shakedown’ caused to the Indian markets due to the Hindenburg Research report will result in ‘much needed institutional reforms’ and ‘democratic revival’. George Soros and his vicious ecosystem of NGOs, activists and journalists had been trying to prove PM Modi as an ‘electoral autocrat’ who needed to be ousted for the ‘greater good’ of this country. And it has been a work in progress for a long time.The Hungarian-American billionaire has also tried to use international institutions, which are funded by him, including Freedom House and  V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute to tarnish the image of India at a global level.In January 2020, the American billionaire committed $1 billion to start a global university to “fight nationalists” and climate change, calling them twin challenges that threaten the survival of our civilisation.Throughout the article, The Washington Post resorted to insinuations, and source-based allegations to discredit ‘Disinfo Lab.’ However, it failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of the Indian OSINT handle.The leftist news outlet had not refuted the assertion by ‘Disinfo lab’ that its exposé had led to the shutting down of several sources of fake data. “In its response to The Post, the Disinfo Lab pointed to its record of forcing “activists” and “human rights fronts” to shut down by exposing them,” it noted.Ironically, one such source of fake data, DOTO (Data of Database of the Oppressed), was cited by WaPo tech ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma in an article in January 2023 to allege that ‘religious hatred’ is on the rise in India.Turned out DOTO was full of fabrication & outright imagination. We exposed their fabrication, after which they first tried revising their data and later deleted and disappeared.DOTO met its fate in October this year and is no more among us. (RIP!)(12/n) pic.twitter.com/y55TrdzNWS‘Disinfo Lab’ had earlier exposed the fabrications of DOTO, following which the latter first revised and then deleted the database. The OSINT handle also uncovered the lies of another dubious organisation called OFMI (Organization for Minorities of India), following which the latter shut shop permanently.But after our exposé they shut down OFMI, pulled down its website, deleted traces, and went into oblivion. Most of the activists associated with them have also removed all references to OFMI.(6/n) pic.twitter.com/uj0DRlnTkhThe leftist media outlet had reached out to prominent people in the hopes of deterring them from sharing informative posts by ‘Disinfo Lab’. The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma messaged American political commentator Jack Posobiec on Friday (8th December) and claimed that the Indian OSINT handle is run by an Intelligence officer.“We are doing a story on a group called Disinformation Lab. Our reporting shows this group combines fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims to paint U.S. government figures, researchers, Indian American human-rights activists and international humanitarian groups as part of a conspiracy, purportedly led by global Islamic groups and the billionaire George Soros, to undermine India. Our analysis found you have retweeted this organisation’s content,” he claimed. Some guy claiming to be from the Washington Post, just sent me a long text message alleging that I retweeted a post from an Indian intel agency-run media outlet Here’s my response pic.twitter.com/hoQcJ4Gjv0He further added, “Do you know about the organization’s background? Our research has found Disinfo Lab is actually run by an Indian Intelligence Officer. Did you know that?“Pranshu Verma then sought a response from the American political commentator based on his unsubstantiated assertions. “Due to the sensitive nature of this story, the time for response is tight. Please provide a response by the end of day today, Friday, December 8th,” he emphasised.However, he did not anticipate a befitting reply from Jack Posobiec that would put ‘The Washington Post’ in the dock. ” So if it’s a intel agency run-media outlet that basically makes it the same as the Washington Post then?” the American political commentator wrote.Jack Posobiec told Verma that The Washington Post is a media outlet run by the United States Intelligence and by his ‘assertion’ would make it similar to ‘Disinfo Lab.’ As expected, the tech ‘journalist’ did not respond to the message.After the article was published, The Washington Post did not reproduce the actual response of Jack Posobiec. While resorting to shrewd dishonesty, it wrote,” Posobiec did not address whether he was familiar with the organisation’s background.“With the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in mind, The Washington Post is leaving no stone unturned to make insinuations about the Modi government and target individuals and accounts known for debunking anti-India propaganda.The development comes amidst growing concerns about ‘regime change’ operations in India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Just last month, The Washington Post published a misleading piece wherein it dubbed requests for action to X (formerly Twitter) against extemists by Indian government as ‘global standard for online censorship.’Earlier, it romanticised an Islamist named Raqib Hameed Naik in an article titled ‘Tracking rising religious hatred in India, from half a world away.’ A vicious fake news peddler, Raqib Hameed Naik is the founder of anti-Hindu disinformation outlet ‘Hindutva Watch.’He is also infamous for denying the Hindu genocide, perpetrated by radical Islamists in the Kashmir Valley, in the early 1990s. Naik had also mocked the Hindu ‘Shivling’ found inside the Gyanvapi mosque in Kashi.The Washington Post has also published a dubious report on India and its solar power systems. It has given editorial space to the likes of scam-accused ‘journalist’ Rana Ayyub to parrot the narrative of ‘Muslims are in danger in India.’None of these articles are random but serve a sinister agenda to create a narrative that paints the incumbent elected government as ‘anti-democracy’ and ‘anti-minority’.In the US, The Washington Post has attempted to distort public perceptions through its dissemination of the Russian disinformation hoax – A conspiracy theory that suggests that the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 US Presidential election was influenced by Russia.It had also suppressed the ‘Hunter Biden Laptop’ story and influenced the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election. With less than 6 months left for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Indian public must be wary of attempts by Western publications to peddle their sinister agendaWhether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The dignity of the parliament house was breached on the night of 21st September when Ramesh Bidhuri abused me. Soul of Gandhi and Ambedkar must be weeping today.TMC’s Krishnanagar MP Mahua Moitra has been expelled from the Lok Sabha after the Ethics Committee tabled its report on her corruption and bribery. She was expelled after the tabled report was debated and a vote was sought from MPs. Soon after Mahua Moitra’s expulsion, the left-liberal ecosystem in politics and media started reacting with tears and rants. From BSP MP Danish Ali saying Gandhi must be weeping to so-called neutral journalists getting goosebumps, every reaction from this clout represented the meltdown they had after the action against the now-former TMC MP.Bahujan Samaj Party MP Danish Ali said, “What is this? The dignity of the parliament house was breached on the night of 21st September when Ramesh Bidhuri abused me. Soul of Gandhi and Ambedkar must be weeping today.”TMC MP Mahua Moitra has been expelled from Lok Sabha.""The souls of Gandhi and Ambedkar must be crying,"" says BSP MP Danish Ali.""A sitting member (Moitra) was expelled from Parliament without being given a chance to defend herself,"" states Prof. Saugata Roy.""Parties of… pic.twitter.com/drzhLQDJyETMC MP Saugata Roy said, “A sitting member (Moitra) was expelled from Parliament without being given a chance to defend herself. All principles of natural justice were clouted. BJP by animal majority voted a member out just because she spoke about industrialist Adani and his relations with Prime Minister Modi.”TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said, “They tried to suppress the voice of opposition. Would not you listen to the one who is accused of so many severe allegations? This never happens. Parties of the I.N.D.I. alliance came together against this decision. It is a huge day for us.”Following the expulsion, Mahua Moitra, known for her tedious and boorish monologues in the parliament, launched another noisy rant outside the Parliament as an ex-MP. Speaking to the media with Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi standing behind her, Mahua Moitra screamed that there was no evidence of any cash or any gifts being taken by her. She even brazened out sharing her login credentials with Darshan Hiranandani, stating that there is no rule specified against sharing login credentials. She then shouted that an MP sharing her credentials with a businessman so that he could pose questions targeted at his rival business entity is not wrong, because MPs are there to raise questions on behalf of the public anyway. Resharing the video of her rant on X, Arfa Khanum Sherwani quoted her sentences and said that she got goosebumps to see Mahua Moitra speak like that. Sherwani posted, “I am 49 years old. I will fight you for the next 30 years. Inside the parliament, and outside on the streets. We are going to come back and we are going to see the end of you. Goosebumps!”I am 49 years old.

Shameful.”Without due process and being given a chance to defend herself #MahuaMoitra is expelled. ShamefulNotably, Mahua Moitra was given a fair opportunity to present her side in front of the ethics committee of the parliament. However, the left-liberal ecosystem kept spreading the lie that she was denied a chance to defend herself. This is because Mahua Moitra reportedly requested to speak on behalf of her party during the discussion after the report of the committee was tabled in the house, but she was denied.India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai posted from his X handle, “So a 104-page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled. An hour later, the TMC MP is formally expelled by voice vote without being given a chance to speak or any of the MPs having even a chance to read the report in any detail and respond. No cross-examination of key witness Darshan Hiranandani. Natural justice anyone? When the issue is as serious as the expulsion of an MP, surely there is a need for a fair hearing and due process, no? Think.”So a 104 page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at 12 noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled. An hour later, the TMC MP is formally expelled by voice vote without being given a chance to speak or any of the MPs…Earlier today, the Ethics Committee report probing ‘Unethical Conduct’ of Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra in the “cash for query” case that was tabled in the Lok Sabha recommended that Moitra “may be expelled” from the Lok Sabha and called for an “intense, legal, institutional inquiry” by the central government in a “time-bound manner”. Moitra is facing a CBI inquiry over serious allegations of corruption, and bribery where she has herself admitted that she had given her login credentials to businessman Darshan Hiranandani to pose questions on her behalf, questions that were related to Hiranandani’s business interests and were targeted to his rival Adani Group. Hiranandani has admitted to paying cash, lavish gifts to Moitra, and having access to her Lok Sabha login credentials.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Around 2.3 million listeners were tuned in when Ramaswamy encountered the hot mic moment. On the X (Twitter) Space, Ramaswamy was participating in a discussion on the future of technology. During the session, Elon Musk was explaining the rationale behind reinstating the banned X account of Alex Jones, founder of the website Infowars, back on his micro-blogging platform. However, interjecting in the conversation, Ramaswamy conveyed that he would have to take a short break, hurriedly stating, “Gentlemen, I have to go.” While Elon Musk continued the discussion, the unmistakable sound of running water could be heard in the background.Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy takes a piss with his mic on during an 𝕏 Space with 100K+ listenersElon Musk: “I hope you feel better”Vivek: “I feel great, thank you” pic.twitter.com/3ljslTqnpXPointing towards unusual noises, Alex Jones sarcastically remarked, “Someone’s got their thing open peeing.

But I am not able to mute you.” On returning from the short break, Vivek Ramaswamy realised that his mic was unmuted and understood what had transpired. He immediately apologised for the embarrassing moment. However, on a lighter note, Musk quips, “I hope you feel better now”. To which Ramaswamy replied, “I feel great.

It was enlarged in 2021 to about 5 lakh square feet. This has allowed a capacity of 50,000 - 75,000 devotees in the temple premises.The Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi has become one of the top pilgrimage spots in India as a record 12.92 crore devotees visited the holy shrine in two years.

This has allowed a capacity of 50,000 – 75,000 devotees in the temple premises.According to CEO Sunil Kumar Verma, efficient management is being done in the temple for the convenience of the devotees. Arrangements like German hangers to protect from the scorching sun in summer, cold, and rain, mats to prevent feet from getting burnt, coolers, pure drinking water, free wheelchairs for disabled people in the month of Shrawan, medical treatment for all, etc. have helped the devotees of Shiva. The path to reach the temple has been made easy.Meanwhile, around 10 crore devotees are expected to visit Ayodhya’s Ram Mandir in 2024 after the consecration ceremony by PM Narendra Modi on 22nd January 2024. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"8 December, 2023 ",High priest to lead the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a descendant of priest who presided over the coronation of Chhatrapati...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/know-the-shivaji-connection-of-priest-who-will-lead-ram-temple-consecration/,"More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. 86-year-old Vedic scholar Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit is expected to preside over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January, marking a landmark confluence of heritage and modern relevance. He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",Omidyar decides to shut shop in India after ‘achieving the goal of catalysing impact’: But here’s why its story might not be over,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/omidyar-decides-to-shut-shop-in-india-no-more-new-investments/,"It is pertinent to note that apart from Omidyar, other donors to Forbidden Story include George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF), whose attitude towards the Indian Government is well documented, and Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, which is cloaked in a shroud of secrecy. Omidyar Network India will exit the Indian market by the end of the year 2024 and will not make any new investments in the country, News website Yourstory first reported on 12th December (Tuesday). Omidyar Network is reportedly a self-styled “philanthropic investment firm” comprising a foundation and an impact investment firm. It was established in 2004 by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, a French-born Iranian-American and his wife Pam. In 2019, Omidyar Network India was carved out of its parent entity, the US-based Omidyar Network. The Omidyar Network India, however, will keep following up on deals it had committed earlier, as per sources familiar with the development. Omidyar Group has been active in India since 2010 and has made investments of over $500 million. Out of this nearly $150 million was directed to non-profit investments. It has invested in several startups in India like ZestMoney, DealShare, VerSe (Dailyhunt), Vedantu, 1mg, Bounce, Bijak, Doubtnut, Entri, HealthKart, Indifi, M2P, Pratilipi, and in several media organisations, particularly the leftist portals like Newslaundry. Confirming the development in an internal blog post which was reviewed by YourStory, the firm stated, “After several months of deliberation, it has been decided that Omidyar Network India will stop making new investments and will completely transition out of the market by the end of 2024. Over the next two months, the board and leadership team will assess how best to manage the organisation’s portfolio while recognising the long and trusted partnerships that the Omidyar Network India team has built.” In their statement, Omidyar Network India asserted that it has achieved its primary objective of “catalysing impact” and will not make any new investment. The statement read, “Over the last decade, Omidyar Network India has played a critical role in building the impact investment sector, especially focussed on the Next Half Billion. We are proud of our work in this space, which is now attracting larger pools of capital from local venture capital or impact investors and domestic philanthropists than ever before. Having achieved our primary objective of catalysing impact, Omidyar Network India will not be making any further investments in India.” Conspicuously, Omidyar Network is known for funding many publications, particularly the leftist portals across India including Scroll(dot)in and Newslaundry.Leftist portals like Newslaundry which are under agencies’ scanner for alleged tax evasions and FCRA violations had been receiving funding from Omidyar Network. In September 2021, the Income Tax department carried out a “survey operation” at the office of the website Newslaundry as part of an investigation into the finances and funding of the organisation.Back then, an IT official had said, “NewsClick and Newslaundry received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) at a very high premium while their net worth was very low. There are also gaps in the financials of both the companies, which suggest tax evasion but we are verifying the same.”Newslaundry received funding from the Odimyar Network in 2016, “to expand its reportage and content production teams, leverage its existing content by increasing its exposure to a larger audience, and experiment with new formats of content creation”.Newslaundry’s Editor-in-Chief Madhu Trehan in an email response to The Print confirmed that Omidyar Network has been funding Newslaundry. The email read, “If you look at our website, you can see how much stake Omidyar Network owns in Newslaundry. It is up on our website. The amount raised and equity percentage is on what was then the FIPB website, and that is public information.” According to the Newslaundry website, the majority of the company’s equity is held by its three co-founders, Abhinandan Sekhri, Roopak Kapoor, and Prashant Sareen, and by an impact fund Omidyar Network.  In 2016, the Omidyar Network issued a public statement on its website at the time of investing in Newslaundry. It read, “Our purpose in funding Newslaundry is to invest in a media organisation that is exploring innovative approaches to drive transparency and higher standards throughout the media landscape in India. We also hope that the learnings from Newslaundry’s journey to develop a new business model for independent news production will act as a blueprint for other organisations to follow, develop, and spread.”Meanwhile, Newsclick founder Prabir Purkayastha has been addressing several events organised by organisations that receive funds from abroad, including from the Omidyar Network. As per an India Today report, in its initial years in India, Omidyar Network backed around 25 organisations that deal with news and government transparency. These organisations include News Trust, a news-discovery site run by the nonprofit journalism center, the Poynter Institute; the Sunlight Foundation, dedicated to government transparency; and Transparency & Accountability Initiative, an organisation based in London.In July 2020, Omidyar Network India funded Rs. 10.75 crore for 67 projects under the rapid response funding initiative for COVID-19 across the country. The initiative was launched on 24th March 2020 and it funded organisations like change.org, Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation, and crowdfunding platform Milaap. Another major beneficiary of Omidyar Network is ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms), which also has the Ford Foundation as one of its donors. In January 2019, Regional language news aggregator Dailyhunt raised Rs 24.61 crore in funding from Omidyar Network and Sequoia Capital among others. Additionally, Verse Innovation, the parent company of Dailyhunt and short video platform Josh, also counts Omidyar Network as its investor.Apart from that, in 2019, it came to light that the Omidyar Group was one of the donors to Forbidden Stories (FS), a dubious organisation launched with the underlying aim of effectuating regime changes and installing pliant governments in countries across the world that align with the left-liberal ideology and reinforce the primacy of the Left’s narrative.FS was launched by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Freedom Voices Network. RSF is the same organisation that came up with a dishonest ‘Press Freedom Index‘ to malign India internationally and portray it as a country where journalists are targeted and persecuted for pursuing truth.The Omidyar Group donated to FS through a front organisation Luminate, whose Strategic Plan for 2018-2022 mentioned “Illiberal democracies’ are emerging,” “Civic space is shrinking, and civil society is under attack,” “Rising populism is creating ruptures in historical party politics,” “Insular, nationalist perspectives are resonating with more people,” and “Communities are becoming more polarized among other things.While the strategic plan and its animosity towards nationalism made its ideological orientations abundantly clear, it is important to note that the Omidyar Group funded a host of media organisations worldwide, mostly leftist globalist portals such as Scroll.in. Scroll Media Inc., the operator of the news portal Scroll.in, secured funding from the Omidyar Network in 2014. However, the exact amount of the funding was not disclosed. During that period, Samir Patil, the CEO of Scroll, mentioned, “We cannot disclose the deal size.”Additionally, in 2008, the Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF) had joined hands with Omidyar Network, the Indian School of Business (ISB), and Google.org to launch their 17 million SONG fund to boost investment. Furthermore, Soros’ Foundation and Omidyar Network have also funded $1.3 million to Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), with a long track record of attempts to thrust a biased fact-checking regime on India’s IFCN network.In September 2023, a coalition of 22 groups, including prominent left-wing organisations pledged more than $500 million to fund local media publications in the next five years, according to an announcement.The new coalition named “Press Forward” includes many groups that have left-wing bias based on their funding and initiatives. One of the groups in this alliance is Democracy Fund, an organisation run by left-wing billionaire Pierre Omidyar.According to tax documents obtained by an independent journalist Lee Fang, Democracy Fund reportedly provided a $130,000 grant to the Center for Internet Security to fund a “portal” that was used to flag and censor social media content containing “misinformation” during the 2020 election.It is pertinent to note that apart from Omidyar, other donors to Forbidden Story include George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF), whose attitude towards the Indian Government is well documented, and Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, which is cloaked in a shroud of secrecy. FS also proudly displayed the endorsement by Mediapart’s Head of Investigations Fabrice Afri on its website until recently. Mediapart is the same leftist French organisation that has been peddling propaganda over the Rafale deal. FS has now removed the page “The support us” altogether from its website.Incidentally, in July 2021, the leftist news portal Wire published what it called an ‘explosive story‘ involving allegations of spying with spyware Pegasus. The Wire and its partners were fed the information by two very dubious organisations. One was Amnesty International and the other was Forbidden Stories.In May 2022, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) named the promoters of NGO Omidyar Network and several others including government officials in an FCRA bribery scandal case. The development came after the CBI had filed an FIR regarding a national FCRA funding scam. According to reports, the promoters of NGO Omidyar Network have been under the scanner for allegedly bribing officials to receive FCRA licenses. Additionally, at least 6 to 8 more networks were also under the CBI scanner.Before that, in September 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs had put the Omidyar Network under the FCRA watchlist.In a nutshell, Omidyar Group invested in organisations and efforts that were aimed to dislodge governments and regimes it thought did not align with the “liberal worldview” by bankrolling news organisations, entities, movies, etc that they thought would aid them in building an alternative narrative and challenging the legitimacy of the incumbent governments they did not like. It had been a “catalysing impact” through various organisations that have been cloaked as non-profit, ideologically independent entities but in reality, have been trying to achieve their vested agenda of pliant governments in the host country.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",Smoke canister attack inside Lok Sabha on the anniversary of 2001 Parliament Attack: Who handles the security of Sansad?,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/smoke-canister-attack-inside-lok-sabha-on-anniversary-of-2001-parliament-attack-who-handles-the-security-of-sansad/,"Apart from providing security, Parliament Security Service is also responsible for activities, including guiding visitors through the Parliament House Complex and providing informative sessions on the history of Parliament and its proceedings.The Parliament Security Service manages the security of both houses of the Parliament, Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. It is situated within the Parliament House Complex. It operates under the administrative control of the Joint Secretary (Security) of the Lok Sabha Secretariat and oversees the security operations of both Secretariats.In August 2020, “Unified Operational Command” was established under the Joint Secretary (Security) to enhance the efficiency and coordination among the security personnel. The unified command integrates the security services of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats. Establishing a Unified Operational Command was to ensure uniformity in decision-making processes related to security matters. Notably, the separate Security Services of both houses run simultaneously as their structures are different.Following the tragic terrorist attack on the Parliament House in 2001, the government of India did a comprehensive review of the security arrangements. Subsequent measures were taken to streamline the access points, advanced security gadgets were deployed, and a high-tech access control system was implemented to ensure the safety and security of the MPs and VVIPs. Furthermore, Radio Frequency Tags were introduced to enhance the identification processes and regulate the vehicular movement inside the complex.The Parliament Security Service plays different roles in the complex, including providing security cover to the VVIPs, Members of Parliament, and visitors and conducting anti-sabotage and anti-explosive checks. Other agencies, including Delhi Police, Intelligence Bureau, Parliament Duty Group, Special Protection Group and National Security Guard, coordinate with the Parliament Security Service to ensure smooth operations in the Parliament.Apart from providing security, Parliament Security Service is also responsible for activities, including guiding visitors through the Parliament House Complex and providing informative sessions on the history of Parliament and its proceedings.Parliament Security Service personnel are also deployed for national ceremonies, international conferences, and other events where security is paramount.In a massive security breach in the Parliament, two men jumped into the Lok Sabha well from the visitors’ gallery while the proceedings were going on today, 13 December. After jumping into the well, the two men released some yellow-coloured smoke from canisters. The invasion of the parliament took place on the anniversary of the parliament attack in 2001.Two more people carrying smoke cans were detained outside the parliament. The incident took place at 1 PM during the zero hour in the Lok Sabha, just before the lunch break. When Khagen Murmu, BJP MP from West Bengal, was raising some points regarding his constituency, a commotion was suddenly heard in the background. When the Sansad TV switched to the view of the entire hall, a man could be seen who had already jumped from the gallery and was on the benches. He then started to proceed towards the front of the hall, jumping from bench to bench. People in the Lok Sabah were heard shouting ‘pakdo, pakdo’ (catch him) before the speaker hurriedly adjourned the house. The livestream was cut immediately after that.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"11 December, 2023 ","Mohit Pandey to be the chief priest of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya: While the leftist ecosystem is linking it with caste, here is why...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mohit-pandey-caste-ram-mandir-leftist-ecosystem/,"Many predictable handles, fanning the casteist divide and playing SC, OBC cards, started linking his selection with Brahminism highlighting his name, Manoj Pandey. The process of selecting priests to perform prayers at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was recently completed. As part of the process, regular applications were invited from interested devotees, and around 3000 people participated. The interested parties had to undergo a rigorous selection process that included specific criteria for choosing the priests for the Ram Mandir. In this entire process, 200 applicants were interviewed, out of which 50 candidates were selected for the post of priests.Subsequently, the reports saying that Mohit Pandey had been selected as the chief priest went viral on social media. Reacting to these reports, certain social media users tried to cast aspersions and raise questions over the selection process for priests asking why only a Brahmin was selected for this post.Many predictable handles, fanning the casteist divide and playing SC, OBC cards, started linking his selection with Brahminism highlighting his name, Manoj Pandey. A Dalit portal named ‘The Mooknayak’ tweeted in Hindi, ” Mohit Pandey will become the priest of Ram temple! Is it forbidden for Dalits to become priests?” ""राम मंदिर के पुजारी बनेंगे मोहित पांडे!""– क्या दलितों का पुजारी बनना मना है? pic.twitter.com/aZRstoJcA0Dilip Mandal fumed and wrote, “This temple is being built by the Government of India as a trust. It is not anyone’s ancestral property. There should be an agitation if the reservation is not given in the temple management. Everyone will give Dakshina and only one caste will withdraw all the money, this will not work.” बहुत सही। वैसे भी ये मंदिर भारत सरकार का ट्रस्ट बना रहा है। किसी के बाप की संपत्ति नहीं है। मंदिर मैनेजमेंट में रिज़र्वेशन न दिया गया तो आंदोलन होना चाहिए। दक्षिणा सब देंगे और सिर्फ सारा पैसा एक जाति के लोग निकालेंगे, ये नहीं चलेगा। https://t.co/Rp2qUwV6BeAn X user named Suraj Yadav in a sarcastic tone claimed that Dalits, OBCs, and Tribals are not Hindus. He wrote, “If he is a Hindu then he is selected. Keep in mind that Dalits, backward people, and tribals are not Hindus. Shudras, Ati Shudras, and people outside the caste system have no place either in the trust or in the place of worship. And this is especially for those Yadavs who are supporters of Manuvad or Brahminism.”हिन्दू है तो चयनित हुआ। दलित, पिछड़े, आदिवासी हिन्दू नहीं हैं, यह ध्यान रहे। शूद्र, अति शूद्र, जाति प्रथा से बाहर लोगों को न तो ट्रस्ट में स्थान है और न ही पूजा स्थल में। और यह उन यादवों के लिए ख़ास तौर से जो मनुवाद या ब्राह्मणवाद के समर्थक हैं। #SC_ST_OBC #ईवीएम_हटाओ… pic.twitter.com/RadVOwhiK9However, the pertinent thing is that those who are casting aspersions, neither know about the selection process nor are they aware of the merit due to which Mohit Pandey was selected for the post of Chief Priest.For those unversed, the necessary condition to become a priest in the Ramlala temple was that the candidate should have studied Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit from a recognised Gurukul. Additionally, the candidate must have been initiated into the Ramanandiya tradition. In line with that, attention was paid to the knowledge of Vedas, rituals, and Vedic mantras during the interview process to select priests for the Ram Mandir. The upper limit for the candidates was fixed at 30 years.Furthermore, despite their selection as Priest and Chief Priest, the selected candidates will have to undergo a long training period, which would last for 6 months, before they start performing their duties. In this training phase, they will be imparted in-depth knowledge of Vedas, rituals, Vedic mantras, and Ramayana. Only after the training phase is over, the priests will be able to perform the worship of Ramlala.As per the selection criteria, it was necessary to be a scholar of the Ramnandiya tradition, as well as to have expertise in the knowledge of Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit. The fact that Mohit Pandey passed all the selection criteria based on merit and ability, just like other candidates who were also evaluated, means that allegations of casteism and religious favoritism don’t arise. Notably, Mohit Pandey studied for seven years at Dudheshwar Ved Vidyapeeth, Ghaziabad. He obtained a Shastri (Bachelor) degree from Sri Venkateswara Vedic University, affiliated with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams in Tirupati. In 2023, he earned a master’s degree in Samaveda. He is also a scholar of the Ramanandiya tradition and possesses expertise in Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit.Likewise, other selected priests include youth from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. All the selected priests belong to the Ramanandiya tradition and have expertise in the Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit.Speaking with The New Indian Express, Professor Rani Sadashiva Murthy, Vice-Chancellor of Sri Venkateswara Vedic University expressed happiness over the selection of Mohit Pandey to the post of Chief Priest of Shri Ram Lal Temple. Murthy said, “Many students from the University serve as priests and acharyas in various temples. A soft-spoken person, Pandey’s nature, focus and dedication to his studies have earned him the opportunity to serve Lord Ram in the esteemed Ayodhya Ram mandir.”Mohit Pandey’s journey, from Ghaziabad to Tirupati and now Ayodhya after being selected as the Chief Priest of Ram Lala, is a testament to his dedication and rigorous training. Institutions like Dudheshwar Ved Vidyapeeth and Sri Venkateswara Vedic University in Ghaziabad have played a crucial role in nurturing individuals with spiritual abilities, as evidenced by their selection process.In such a situation, those who are pointing fingers at his selection and linking it with castism are vitiating society by fanning the caste divide. While the ecosystem has been carrying out smear campaigns and cast aspersions, it is important to highlight that there are several temples in different states of India, there are not only Dalit or Women priests, prayers are performed by Dalit women priests in these temples.In a previous article, OpIndia highlighted temples in which women and Dalits have been performing the responsibility of priests.

After closely listening to the lyrics in the video, OpIndia was able to find a transcript of the poem that was uploaded on the website ‘Kobita Cocktail in 2019. The name of the poet was mentioned as Akhtaruzzaman Azad.We found that Azad is a Dhaka-based author and has more than 1.12 lakh followers on Facebook. It became clear that he indeed wrote the poem in the context of Bangladesh, although Indian singer Mousumi Hossain featured in the viral video. On further digging into the matter, OpIndia was able to trace the video on the timeline of Akhtaruzzaman Azad. The video was posted on 29th June last year.In the caption, the poet informed that the name of the poem is ‘Awoj Abar Tolo’ which loosely translates to ‘Raise Your Voice now.’ The poem deals with the subject of religious extremism and selective outrage by various religious denominations (Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists). Each stanza, barring the last and penultimate, is dedicated to the antics of followers of each Faith.The poet Akhtaruzzaman Azad calls upon society to shed religious differences, stop the bloodshed and see the goodness in one another. The poem has been recited like a song by singer Mousumi Hossain. It must be mentioned that only the first stanza of the poem (and not the entirety of it), concerning the hypocrisy of Muslims living in Bangladesh, has been going viral on social media.In that particular stanza, the poet highlights how believers in Allah (Mumin) are willing to cry their hearts out on learning about murders in Palestine or the plight of Rohingyas in Myanmar. He emphasises how Muslims are ever-ready to wail about ‘saving Gaza’ but have no tears to shed for Hindus dying in Bangladesh. The poem brings out the distinction in this selective ‘concern for humanity.’ –In the first stanza, the poet highlights how the Muslim community screams over the death of someone named ‘Malik or Khalik ‘ but does not even whisper for a deceased named ‘Naresh or Paresh’.While concluding the first stanza, Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions how the Muslim community in Bangladesh can live with such glaring double-standards. He talks about the behavioural patterns of followers of other Faiths such as Hinduism, Christianity and Buddhism in the second, third and fourth stanzas.In the end, he the poet makes an appeal for peace among different factions of the society.Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the 1-year-old video is going viral on social media. Given that the poem by Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions the selective silence of the Muslim community in Bangladesh (in the first stanza), which perfectly fits a pattern in the Islamic world, it is gaining traction among netizens. বাংলাদেশে বিবেক এখনো বেঁচে আছে। আমার প্রণাম নিন। আখতারুজ্জামান আজাদের কবিতা–""এই যে তুমি মস্ত মুমিন, মুসলমানের ছেলে;বক্ষ ভাসাও, ফিলিস্তিনে খুনের খবর পেলে।রোহিঙ্গাদের দুঃখে তুমি এমন কাঁদা কাঁদো;ভাসাও পুরো আকাশ-পাতাল, ভাসাও তুমি চাঁদও!অশ্রু তোমার তৈরি থাকে— স্বচ্ছ এবং তাজা;Ex-Governor of Meghalaya, Tathagatha Roy, shared the poem on X (formerly Twitter) on 1st November, 2023.The video is equally popular on Facebook amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","Gujarat: AAP MLA Bhupat Bhayani resigns, says ‘AAP not a proper platform to work for country’; speculations of two more MLAs leaving the party",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/gujarat-aap-mla-bhupat-bhayani-resigns-set-to-join-bjp-again/,"Bhupat Bhayani said that only due to nationalist ideology, he decided to leave the Aam Aadmi Party and has taken this decision after discussing it with the people of his constituency.In Gujarat, the Aam Aadmi Party suffered a major setback before the Lok Sabha elections. AAP MLA Bhupat Bhayani resigned from the party and the post of MLA on Wednesday (13th December). He has said that he is leaving the Aam Aadmi Party due to nationalist ideology. The speaker of the Gujarat state assembly has accepted Bhayani’s resignation.Bhupat Bhayani said that only due to nationalist ideology, he decided to leave the Aam Aadmi Party and has taken this decision after discussing it with the people of his constituency. It has been only one year since the assembly elections. The MLA’s exit has also dealt a major blow to AAP’s preparations for the Lok Sabha elections. On Wednesday at 10:45 AM, Bhayani handed in his resignation to the Assembly Speaker, Shankar Chaudhary. The Speaker announced that Bhayani personally delivered his resignation today, and it was duly accepted.The Aam Aadmi Party is preparing to contest elections in Gujarat under the I.N.D.I. alliance. Bhupat Bhayani said that he was earlier in the BJP and was associated with the ideology of nationalism. He said that he was going to leave the Aam Aadmi Party and join the BJP only because of the ideology of nationalism.Bhayani said, “I cannot be against PM Modi and I belong to nationalist ideology. That is why I have decided to leave the Aam Aadmi Party. Aam Aadmi Party is not the appropriate platform to work in the interest of the country.” Although he did not clarify when he would join the BJP, he accepted that he would join the party for sure. He said that if the party wants, he will contest the election once again.Bhupat Bhayani, a BJP member for 14 years, joined the Congress and won the 2017 elections. Then he made a surprising shift to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) just before the 2022 elections. Winning a seat as an MLA from Visavadar on the AAP ticket, he faced talks of resignation within a week of his victory. Initially, he deferred the decision, stating that he would consult with the people in his constituency before concluding. However, a year later, he decided to step down from his legislative position. This resignation has once again disrupted the functioning of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly. Throughout the past few decades, the assembly has not consistently retained its full complement of 182 legislators, with disruptions occurring due to various factors such as the passing of a legislator or changes in political affiliations.AAP state president Isudan Gadhvi has said in his first reaction that the BJP is running a dictatorship, and forcing MLAs to resign. He said that the BJP is afraid of Aam Aadmi Party.Currently, only four AAP legislators remain in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly, and they may also encounter challenges in the run-up to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. It is speculated that 2 more MLAs from the Aam Aadmi Party may also resign. According to a report by Divya Bhaskar, after the resignation of Bhupat Bhayani, now Botad MLA Umesh Makwana and Gariadhar MLA Sudhir Vaghani can also resign. The report said that MLA Makwana will make an official announcement soon.According to a report by Zee 24 Kalak, Sudhir Vaghani is also unhappy with the party and can leave the party at any time. But in a conversation with TV9, Sudhir Vaghani denied these claims and said that he was not resigning. There was no statement from Umesh Makwana in this regard.AAP MLA, Sudhir Vaghani denied leaving the party, criticizing #BhupatBhayani's action #Gujarat #TV9News pic.twitter.com/oxU5Wp17jfSimilar claims are being made in many other reports and it is being said that two more AAP MLAs may resign. It is also being speculated that all the MLAs of the Aam Aadmi Party will leave the party before the Lok Sabha elections. There is also talk of the resignation of a Congress MLA.The Aam Aadmi Party won only five seats in the Gujarat Assembly elections while losing deposits in 128 seats. The five seats are Botad, Gariadhar, Visavadar, Jamjodhpur and Dediapada. The MLA of Visavadar has already resigned. It is said that the MLAs of Gariadhar and Botad may also resign. Meanwhile, Chaitar Vasava, the MLA from Dediapada, has been absconding for several weeks in connection with assaulting forest department workers.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",‘Don’t make us reactivate earlier order of attaching Delhi ad budget’: SC warns Kejriwal govt of tough action for not releasing funds for RRTS...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/sc-warns-kejriwal-govt-of-diverting-deljis-ad-budget-if-it-does-note-release-fund-for-rrts-project/,"The Supreme Court then gave 7 days to the Delhi government to release the funds for the project, asking it to strictly follow the schedule of investmentOn 13th December (Wednesday), the Supreme Court issued a stern warning to Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal government over the delay in providing funds for the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS). The court observed that the Delhi government should refrain from compelling the court to pass ‘tough orders’. The bench noted that if the Delhi government doesn’t pay its share of dues for the project, it will be forced to reactivate the earlier order and attach the AAP government’s advertisement budget.  Notably, in November this year, Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Sudhanshu Dhulia directed that if the Delhi government fails to allocate funds for the Rapid Rail project, the amount will be redirected from the Arvind Kejriwal government’s advertisement budget for the current year.During the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had observed that the problem was that the Delhi government could make a budgetary provision of Rs 580 crore for advertisements but it could not make a budgetary provision of Rs 400 crore as part of its share for the vital infrastructure project.Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had said, “If such national projects are affected, and if money is being spent on advertising, we would be inclined to ask the money to be directed to the infrastructure”.Pertinently, the Supreme Court was apprised today that the Delhi government has still not paid its share for the RRTS project during the ongoing hearing on pleas concerning air pollution in Delhi. Adv: The Delhi government has still not paid (its share of RRTS).Sr Adv S Muralidhar for Delhi government: The minute the government of India (officially) approves the project, we will release these funds. NCRTC website says Centre has not.#SupremeCourtResponding to the charges, the Delhi government’s counsel Senior Advocate S Muralidhar defended the delay in funding. Muralidhar argued that the Delhi government will release these funds when the government of India officially approves the project. He claimed that the NCRTC website says the Centre has not done it, adding that Delhi-Alwar and Delhi-Panipat Corridor projects are yet to be approved by the Centre. The advocate claimed that Delhi govt has made budgetary provisions for the projects, and the funds will be released after the projects are approved.In reply, the bench warned, “These are new excuses (smiles). We are not afraid to pass tough orders. If you do not pay why will even other States pay.” The court also noted that other states have released their share of the funds, and therefore the Delhi govt also should do the same.The opposing counsel pointed out that these projects are sanctioned through international plans and delays escalate the cost. SC: Mr Muralidhar you will make me reactivate my earlier order (of attaching Delhi ad budget).#SupremeCourtThe bench stated, “Mr Muralidhar you will make me reactivate my earlier order (of attaching Delhi ad budget).” The Supreme Court then gave 7 days to the Delhi government to release the funds for the project. The court strictly directed the state govt to abide by the schedule concerning the allocation of funds for this project.Meanwhile, earlier on Monday (11th December), the Supreme Court had slammed the Delhi government over its ‘lackadaisical approach’ towards providing funds to the Delhi High Court and district judiciary for infrastructure development.The bench was headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and included Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra. The bench said, “What is happening? What is your government doing? You don’t want to give any funds to the Delhi High Court? We need approval by Thursday. It is a model High Court and look at the condition. Judges are undergoing training and there are no courtrooms.” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ",First-time MLA and four-time state General Secretary Bhajan Lal Sharma: BJP signals organisational importance in choosing new CM for Rajasthan,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-rajasthan-general-secretary-bhajan-lal-sharma-cm/,"He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), contrary to the media speculations, announced Bhajan Lal Sharma as the CM-designate of Rajasthan. Further, his appointment is seen as a major deviation from the general political trend. Usually, seniority and political growth had been adjudged by the number of times a leader has been elected to the state assembly or Lok Sabha. 56-year-old Bhajan Lal Sharma is a first-time MLA. He completed his MA (politics) from Rajasthan University, Jaipur, in 1993.He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The BJP had fielded him after denying a ticket to the sitting MLA Ashok Lahoti. However, Sharma, a resident of Bharatpur, is said to have a strong hold on organisational politics. Before plunging into electoral politics, he had been working in the organisation for a long time. Bhajan Lal Sharma has been playing an important part in BJP’s organisational structure in Rajasthan. He has served as the state general secretary for the Bharatiya Janata Party four times. Previously, he had been associated with RSS and ABVP. For this reason, he is considered close to the party’s ideological mentor RSS, and party chief JP Nadda.The three major announcements on three consecutive days have signalled that the organisational importance played a major role in these major selections. A key similarity in these decisions has been the history of these leaders in serving various organisational roles and strengthening the party’s cadre in these states. Apart from Sharma, Dr. Mohan Yadav, the new CM-designate of Madhya Pradesh had held several organisational posts in BJP and its ideological mentor RSS. Yadav, who started student politics at Madhav Science College, and held many positions in the party. In 1982, he was the co-secretary of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union and in 1984, he was the President of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union.Mohan Yadav assumed the responsibility of Municipal Minister of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Ujjain) in the year 1984 and Department Head in 1986. In the year 1988, Yadav was the state co-secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Madhya Pradesh) and a member of the national executive. He was the State Minister of the State Unit of the Council in 1989-90 and the National Minister of the Council in the year 1991-92. In 1993-95, he served as the functionary (Sangh Karyavah) of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Ujjain Nagar. Additionally, his appointment was also seen as a major signal of political empowerment for the Yadav community, a dominant political force in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, however, have lacked proper proportional representation owing to the family-oriented politics of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD). Similarly, Vishnu Deo Sai, the next CM-designate of Chhattisgarh held the top organisational post in BJP’s Chhattisgarh unit. He served as Chhattisgarh BJP President from 2006 to 2013. His appointment also signalled a strong empowerment for the tribal community which was earlier witnessed when BJP-led NDA picked Droupadi Murmu for the Presidential post.   With all these new appointments, BJP signals that its motto ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’ (inclusivity) will be counter to the opposition’s push for caste census and proportional representation. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","As TV reporters shamelessly fight for smoke canister thrown in Parliament, here are a few things we should all be worried about after witnessing...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-fight-colour-canister-parliament-few-things-we-should-be-worried-about/,"If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai who admitted that they were like vultures. On the 13th of December 2023, there was a serious security breach in the Parliament of India. Two individuals hurled a smoke canister from the viewer gallery. They then jumped to the floor of the house and were trying to make their way towards the speaker when were overpowered by parliamentarians. Thereafter they were detained by the police and taken for interrogation. Just as the security breach took place, there were two individuals outside the parliament protesting with similar colour smoke canisters. According to preliminary information from the Delhi Police, there is no terror angle to the incidents, however, the police are taking the breach seriously. According to reports, the intruder inside the parliament was chanting slogans about “Kaala Kanoon” and the protestors outside the Parliament were chanting slogans like Jai Bhim, Tanashahi Nahi Chalegi, Manipur ko Insaf do, etc. While the country was shocked by the serious security breach and the ramifications of the lapse, Indian media was conducting their very own circus. A video emerged where TV journalists were seen fighting like animals over the smoke canister that was hurled by the protestors. In the video put out by TV9, their journalist was showing the smoke canister on camera. While he was doing his segment, other journalists started trying to snatch the canister saying that he had used it enough and should hand over the canister to other journalists. When the other journalists started trying to snatch the canister, the TV9 journalist was seen almost sprinting with it, trying to get a few more seconds with the canister – for the sake of the hard-hitting coverage of the unfolding incident at the Parliament. As the nation had important questions that the media should have been focussing on – like how this security breach took place, who were the intruders, what were they chanting, why they did what they did, what was the police doing and how visitors entered the parliament with canisters and why were the Delhi Police so lackadaisical in arrested the protestors outside the Parliament, almost looking like they were taking them for a walk, these elements in the media seemed far more interested in ridiculous sensationalism and showing visuals of the canister. While we watched this circus unfold, there are several important aspects that people need to be extremely worried about. First and foremost, one has to wonder about the priorities of the media and what they choose to cover when important events unfold. As mentioned, there are very important questions that need to be answered as this security breach unfolds. The Parliament is not just a building but a symbol of the democracy of India and the seat of power. Any attack on the Parliament is an attack on democracy and the sovereignty of India itself. While these events unfolded, the journalists on the ground should have been far more focused on bringing crucial details to the people of the nation. And while several journalists were doing so, some were indulging in cheap sensationalism. This, however, comes as no surprise. One is reminded of the time when Rajdeep Sardesai was talking about the 2001 Parliament Attack – the terrorist attack that incidentally took place on this day 22 years ago. In 2018, a video had gone viral where Rajdeep Sardesai admitted that journalists were vultures. Sardesai in the video recounted the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament where he and his crew were preparing for a picnic owing to a slow news day. Preparing for a feast in the garden near the Parliament, he and his team entered the Parliament at around 11 am. Within minutes of the team entering the Parliament, he says they heard gunshots. The Parliament was attacked. He then recalled that when his colleague asked him to leave, he directed him to suggest the guard to close the gates. He explained with a wide grin that he did so so that no other channel crew could enter. Those days there were fewer channels and Sardesai was excited at the prospect of doing an exclusive story.He then says how the exclusive story of the parliament attack made the team forget the wine and kababs they were planning to picnic on. “It was a great day. We are like vultures. We feed on these moments.” he added.If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran vultures like Rajdeep Sardesai. While the conduct of the media was abysmal, what is far more concerning is the conduct of the Delhi Police and security agencies. When a security breach like this has taken place, one would imagine that the police and law enforcement agencies would ask the media to stand back – after all, 26/11 was a classic case of how the media could potentially jeopardise any rescue operation and investigation when such incidents take place. During the Mumbai Attack, the police allowed unbridled access to the media, resulting in journalists like Barkha Dutt potentially giving away crucial information on hostages from ISI handlers who were closely monitoring the media. Taking a lesson from the past, the police should have summarily kept the media away. That canister itself could be crucial evidence that the police need, instead, the media was yet again given unbridled access to play with the canister as if were some sort of a prop in a drama. On the 22nd anniversary of the ghastly 2001 Parliament attack, the parliament was under severe threat. There were Khalistani and other terror organisations which had issued threats against the Parliament. While now the police are claiming that the smoke was not harmful, while the breach was ongoing, the police had to function under the assumption that it could be a deadly terror attack which could have dire ramifications. Despite that, the media was given unbridled access knowing fully well that such media has a history of creating a circus during serious incidents. Several other questions are being raised against the police as the Parliament’s security was breached. Visitors to the Parliament are frisked at every stage and there are now questions being asked as to how the security could have been so wanting that two individuals with smoke canisters could enter the Parliament. Per protocol, those who have passes to view the Parliament proceedings are not allowed to carry a paper inside the Parliament. Legitimate concerns are now being raised as to how, amid such tight security, two individuals could enter with these canisters. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ","Antisemitism is not new to US campuses including Ivy Leagues, their credibility is questionable for more reasons than one. Here’s why",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/antisemitism-not-new-to-us-campuses-their-credibility-questionable/,"While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A mix of Georgian and Victorian-era inspired academic buildings are spread across the Northeastern United States. Besides the entitled exclusivity in the admissions process, the unreasonable fee structure and the decorated syllabus, there is also a sadistic appeal to the Gothic appearance these institutions boast of.But, to quote Shakespeare, all that glitters is not gold.The holier-than-thou attitude over the decades of US’s Ivy Leagues – touted as the world’s most esteemed and prestigious universities – was brought to its knees when presidents of two of the three universities, Harvard and Penn, and the third being the high-ranking MIT, refused to condemn calls for genocide of Jews at a congressional hearing on 5th December.On 5th December, a congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” was held in Washington, D.C.At the hearing, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Her specific yes or no question to them was, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s rules or code of conduct regarding bullying or harassment?”MIT President Sally Kornbluth responded saying that “if targeted at individuals and not making public statements”. When asked for a yes or no answer, Kornbluth said that she has not heard calls for the genocide of Jews on MIT campus.The Congresswoman questioned, “But you have chants for intifada?” To this, Kornbluth replied, “I have heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.”She said that such calls would be investigated as harassment only “if pervasive and severe”.President (now former) of University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill’s response came with wide smiles and smirks. She said, “If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes.”When questioned again, Magill said that if such speech is directed and severe and pervasive, it is harassment. When asked if she means a yes, Magill said it is a context-dependent decision.She maintained that “if the speech becomes conduct, it is harassment”. Magill finally responded with a yes after much struggle. President of Harvard, Dr Claudine Gay reiterated the same chorus in answer to the question.“It (the call for genocide of Jews) can be (violate rules) depending on the context,” Dr Gay said. When asked what the context is she said, “targeted as an individual, targeted at an individual.”“Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, it amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action,” Dr Gay said.The roughly 3 minute 31 second long video of the hearing took social media by the storm prompting angry responses from netizens. The matter has escalated with key stakeholders demanding accountability from the presidents of the respective universities.President Liz Magill of University of Penn has resigned amid mounting pressure.The focus of the hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce was the rise in cases of antisemitism reported on campuses across the US and the universities’ response to the same.This comes in the backdrop of the 7th October terrorist attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel killing at least 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200 to Gaza. Israel has since vowed to avenge the death of its people and has launched an all-out offensive against the terrorist group.A selective support for Palestinians toeing the Hamas line has since mushroomed in campuses across the United States. In the name of human rights of Palestinians, the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel has been justified on the campuses of these so-called prestigious institutions with absolutely no repercussions from the administration.On 11th October, four days after the brutal attack on Israel, a group of Harvard students submitted a letter in support of Palestine. This prompted several corporate institutions, particularly those with Jewish heads, warning Harvard that they will not hire students supporting Hamas. Several Jewish donors to the universities also threatened to withdraw their donations.On 25th October, Jewish students at Cooper Union college in New York had to be locked inside library for their own safety as pro-Palestinian students tried to break down the door chanting “Free Palestine”. The Jewish students had to be escorted out through tunnels using the back door.On 18th October, a “Stop the genocide in Gaza” die-in demonstration was reportedly organised by the Harvard Business School. A video from the demonstration showed a Jewish student mobbed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators screaming “shame, shame, shame”.On 24th October, an antisemitic slogan was displayed on the wall of the library of George Washington University. It read, “Free Palestine From The River To The Sea.” Another message read, “Glory to our martyrs” and one read, “End the siege on Gaza”.While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A complaint letter via e-mail by the Jewish rights group ‘Brandeis Center’ to the University of Pennsylvania alleged that the latter had allowed its campus to become a hostile environment for Jewish students and a magnet for antisemites.It pointed to a festival that was organised by the university titled “Palestine Writes Festival” which hosted antisemitic speakers. Notably, this festival came days before the terrorist attacks proving the antisemitism is pre-existing sentiment on campuses in the US.The letter read, “In the days leading up to the September Festival, anti-Semitic graffiti and a Penn student’s violent attack on Penn’s Hillel signaled trouble to come for Jewish students and institutions on campus.”Surprisingly, the festival was organised on the same day as the Jewish festival ‘Jewish High Holy Days of Awe”. Meanwhile, Magill, despite concerns raised by several members, stood by the event citing “free speech”.Even now, as recently as 9th December (Saturday), Jewish students in the Penn University are being subjected to chants like “We are Hamas” whereas openly antisemitic professors and staff are still employed with the university.Forget even the recent decades, antisemitism on US campuses goes back nearly a century. In the 1950s, Stanford University reportedly tried to limit the proportion of its Jewish students.Stanford University is located on the West Coast of the US and is not an Ivy League university but ranks higher than Ivy League varsities.Another report reveals that the Seth Low Junior College (SLJC) near the Columbia University was “created with the explicit goal of reducing the amount of Jewish students on the CU campus”. It was built in the early 20th century.As per the report, the “enrollment of Jewish students at Columbia College after Seth Low Junior College’s opening dropped from 40 to 25 per cent”. Moreover, on one hand, half of the total Columbia College applicants were accepted, only one in six Jewish applicants were admitted in the early 20th century.This was reportedly the case in most East Coast schools in the US.One might think that on-campus antisemitism is an elephantine problem which dwarfs any other controversies surrounding academic campuses in America.Not really. The political invasion of campuses in America which is being exposed with hatred for Jews and Israel has only compounded their already declining credibility.The larger-than-life projected image of these institutions in the US has been a facade which has been maintained through endowments, donations and charities flowing in like dirt, open political biases, crippling admissions fees thereby giving academic access to only a handful, racial and gender persecution, and woke agendas.You’d be surprised, if not shocked, to know that it was only in June this year that the US Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer determine race as grounds for admissions.Up till the US SC verdict, race was still very much a part of the admissions process in the United States centered around the idea of “positive discrimination”.And yet, the move was decried by the left-liberal media in the US as the end of “affirmative action”.Racism has been rampant, like a regular petty crime, on US campuses including the so-called esteemed campuses. This has only served to fan left wing politics in the US where voices are raised prominently when incidents involve a black victim.But when Asian or Indian students are subjected to racism, the same woke left wing crowd goes into hiding. Safe to say, US campuses are not merely dealing with crimes of unabated racism but several politicised versions of it.In 2020, Princeton University had acknowledged that systemic racism exists on its campus following which an investigation was launched by the Trump administration.Columbia University graduate Emma Sulkowicz made headlines in 2015 by staging a protest based on performance art against alleged sexual harassment.Sulkowicz walked around the campus carrying a 50-pound mattress and across the stage during her graduation to symbolise the weight carried around by victims of sexual assault.She had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a classmate of rape during her sophomore year in 2013. The accused was cleared of the charges following a hearing by the university.In 2017, three professors in Dartmouth’s department of psychological and brain sciences were accused of sexual abuse and misconduct. The professors reportedly resigned or retired following recommendations for dismissal.However, the seven women who levelled the charges alleged that the college had failed to protect its students from sexual harassment and sexual assault.A scandal broke out in Cornell University last year exposing alleged incidents of sexual assault and druggings at off-campus fraternity parties. A crime alert was issued early in November 2022 by the campus police responding to four different reports of students being drugged and at least once case of sexual assault.In May 2022, a longtime professor at Princeton named Joshua Katz was suspended after investigation revealed that he had sex with one of his undergraduate students years ago.In 2021, several complaints surfaced against the professor from mid-2000s alleging disturbing cases of allegedly propositioning undergraduates for sexual relationships.In 1986, a shocking scandal was uncovered in Brown University wherein students were allegedly linked to a sex worker ring in Providence. Multiple students were charged with sex work crimes and drug possession.According to The Washington Post, Harvard in 2022 warned all undergraduate students that “cisheterosexism,” “fatphobia” and “using the wrong pronouns” amounted to “abuse” and perpetuated “violence” on campus.In May this year, the student government at the Northwestern University in Illinois “indefinitely” froze the funds of the College Republicans over an event poster showing conservative speaker James Lindsay, critical of transgenderism.After an uproar that has been dragging in the US over participation of trans athletes in women’s sports, a bill was approved by the House Republicans in April this year barring such transgender athletes whose biological sex awas assigned at birth as male from competing on girls’ or women’s sports teams.As if the use of a thousand pronouns for individually-preferred “gender” identification has not disadvantaged academically-focused students enough, transgenders participating against females in sports has most definitely put the latter at a physical disadvantage.High-profile names involving celebrities and politicians and their aides were at the center of a massive admissions scandal across universities.College athletics coaches and test administrators accepted bribes and donations in exchange for recruiting students. The mastermind, William Rick Singer, was paid a whopping $25 million by celebrity parents to bribe coaches and university administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits to facilitate their admission.Singer allegedly created fake charities to facilitate money for “donations” to various colleges including Yale University, Georgetown, Stanford and the University of Southern California.The big names involved in the scandal include Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman, Mossimo Giannulli, William H Macy, Michelle Janavs and many more. One of the more prominent names is Gordon Ernst, former Georgetown University tennis coach known for having coached the Obamas.In 2022, a professor at Columbia University, Michael Thaddeus, published a paper accusing the varsity of manipulating data to project that it spent more on research and instruction than it actually did.This, reportedly, in turn is suspected to have played a role in the Ivy League institution’s jump in the rankings. The university later admitted that they had reported incorrect data but refused to admit that it was done to improve rankings.As per the professor’s report, the varsity’s rankings moved up from no. 18 in 1988 to no 2 by 2022. Following the controversy, Columbia, Yale and Harvard announced that they would no longer participate in the rankings in the future.The rise of wokeism on university campuses in US can easily be attributed to left-wing bias. In fact, it can be considered a branch of the same tree.According to a poll, Republicans have the least amount of confidence (19%) in higher education in the United States whereas Democrats have the highest level of confidence at 59%.Another related survey reportedly found that 77% of college presidents in the US agree that the perception of colleges as intolerant of conservative views has impacted people’s attitudes about higher education.According to a report, US universities have been receiving funding from Qatar particularly in the period between 2001 and 2021, “precisely after the September 11 attacks”.As per the report based on a study published in 2022, a staggering $4.7 billion was injected into universities in the United States. Moreover, the recipients did not report part of the money received as required by the law.“Qatar has reportedly become the largest foreign donor to American academic in the two decades since 9/11,” the report reads.In 2020, the Trump administration alleged that top US universities have “massively underreported” foreign funding from China, Russia and other nations described as “foreign adversaries”.According to another report, Saudi Arabia owned oil company ARAMCO has been funding programmes in US universities like Princeton since as early as the 1950s. Moreover, Middle East studies programme in US institutions reportedly receive specifically from Arab countries to “advance their political agendas”.“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the Saudis have seen such donations as a way to acquire goodwill, legitimacy and support in U.S. academia,” the report quotes NYU professor Zachary Lockman. Interestingly, it must be noted that some of the biggest names like George Soros and the Rothschilds, which bestow donations in billions to the US acadmia, are Jewish. And it is thus a wonder as to how these institutions, funded equally well by the left-liberal globalist disruptors like their Middle Eastern counterparts, have been unable to counter antisemitism. Yet, when questions are raised against these conglomerates, they coin the term antisemitism through their rights groups and NGOs in their defence.All in all, Universities in the US are too good to be true for their realities have been exposed for all to see since a long time. It is time to stop trusting every colonial infrastructure just because they put on a good show of elitist exclusivity. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"7 December, 2023 ","How The Hindu consoled itself and shielded Rahul Gandhi after electoral drubbing in 3 states: Blaming regional leaders, voters, Hindutva and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/the-hindu-shields-rahul-gandhi-electoral-loss-3-states-regional-leaders-voters-hindutva/,"The Gandhi family must realise how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is praiseworthy! By now, we are all used to the Congress party leaders crediting the Gandhi family for victories and blaming the regional leaders for their defeats. It is understandable why they are forced to do this. However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"6 December, 2023 ",31 years of Babri demolition: Remembering the Karsevaks who razed the face of adharma to the ground to pave the way for a Bhavya...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/babri-demolition-by-karsevaks-paved-the-way-for-ram-mandir-temple-in-ayodhya/,"While centuries of struggle to reclaim Dharma culminated in November 2019 when the Supreme Court of India handed over the encroached land in Ayodhya to Hindus, paving the way for the construction of a Bhavya Ram Mandir, the events that transpired on 6 December 1992 hold profound significance, for it manifested in the starkest form the passions and devotion of Karsevaks in wanting to liberate the birthplace of Lord Rama. Saryu Mata (the Holy river in Ayodhya) bears witness to the events and incidents of Ramayana in the Treta Yug to the reclamation of the Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in the present day. She was the source for Bhagwan Ram, a reincarnation of Bhagwan Vishnu, and his devotees in Ayodhya to return to Vishnu Ji’s abode Vaikunth Dham.On 2nd November 1990, once again, albeit in shocking circumstances, the souls of Shri Ram’s devotees departed for Vaikunth right from the banks of Saryu. The Mulayam Singh-led UP Police had opened fire on a large group of kar sevaks who had come to Ayodhya to demand that the Babri structure be demolished and Ram Mandir be reconstructed.The Kothari brothers – Ram (23) and Sharad (20) Kothari – were the first ones to mount a Saffron flag atop the Babri controversial structure. A report filed on 3rd November 1990 in Jansatta said that an unidentified kar sevak from Sriganganagar, Rajasthan fell after being shot and as he fell, he wrote “Sitaram” on the road with his blood.It remains a mystery whether the Karsevak had written his name or was his devotion and adherence towards Lord Ram that made him write “Sitaram” in his own blood.The report mentioned that even after Karsevak fell to the ground, the CRPF personnel shot seven bullets into his skull.As per official figures, 16 kar sevaks were killed in cold blood. But actual numbers are believed to be much higher. Their only crime was that they staged peaceful demonstrations by expressing their religious reverence and singing bhajans.Little did they know that their act would send a wave across the country that would come right back to hit that very spot on 6th December 1992 for nothing and no one could soil the spirit of Ram Bhakts. 25 months later, on 6th December 1992, Hindus reminded the world once again that they hadn’t remotely been deterred in their fight for divine justice.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad organised a kar seva in Ayodhya in 1992 and an area was marked for worship on 6th December. Kar sevaks from across the country began to pour into Ayodhya in large numbers even as security personnel were deployed in equally large numbers.According to Mahant Brajmohan Das, who witnessed the demolition of the Babri structure on 6th December 1992, the birthplace of Shri Ram was filled with joy and enthusiasm. “Only those who were present in Ayodhya on that day can explain what God’s miracles and powers are,” he said.All arrangements including food, accommodation et cetera were made for thousands of devotees. “There seemed to be complete Ram Rajya in Ayodhya,” he said. Despite what ensued in 1990, the number of karsevaks visiting Ayodhya in 1992 and security personnel deployed was so large that the Mahant said that if the massacre was repeated, no one would come out alive.Finally, on 6th December 1992, a kar sevak entered an empty bus belonging to the security forces near Hanumangarhi and raced it towards the Babri structure shattering all barricades and paving the way for kar sevaks who followed.Call it divine intervention, the symbol of tyranny, savagery and bigotry was razed to dust that day; this formed the cornerstone of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Kar sevaks cut the barbed wire barricading the Babri structure and climbed atop it.The three worn-out tombs of the Babri structure were brought down in less than 6 hours amid Holy chants of Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram. This was the first line of treatment for the wounded Hindu civilisation, all thanks and namans (bowing down) to the kar sevaks who risked their lives once again.Documentaries were made by the mainstream media to blot the image of kar sevaks, nat up sounds of Jai Shri Ram were played by the ecosystem of the day to push a narrative to demonise the Holy chant.Even as the Hindus, the kar sevaks removed the Babri structure from the face of the earth – as should be the case with every symbol of adharma (roughly translating to injustice) – we paid the price for it in the war of narratives that were to come.Hindus displayed to the world that when justice is delayed and denied when a civilisation seeking justice is brutalised and demonised, we will come to our own defence.Come to think of it, our patience knows no bounds but when we are pushed to the edge and tested, we end adharma once and for all – be it slaying Ravan in Treta Yug, demolishing Babur’s Babri structure in 1992 or bulldozing the mafia to the ground today.31 years on, every year on this day a certain ecosystem mourns the physical death of Babri structure while the civilisational wounds of a devout Hindu continue to be healed. On 22nd January 2024, Ram Lalla’s Pran Pratishtha will be performed and He will finally be resting comfortably watching over us from His Bhavya Mandir.On 6th December 2023, we must remember and celebrate the men and women across the nation who enabled this movement and reignited hope in Hindus. They taught us that bullets and barricades can’t kill our souls. We must dare to demolish injustice to the ground every time it pops its ugly face and pave the way for justice.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 November, 2023 ","No, Shakib Al Hasan wasn’t beaten up on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup: Here’s the truth about the viral video",https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/shakib-al-hasan-wasnt-beaten-up-on-his-return-to-bangladesh-after-world-cup-truth-about-the-viral-video/,"An old video of Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib Al-Hasan being beaten up and shoved around is going viral on social media with the claim that the all-rounder had been pushed around on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup. In the wake of Bangladesh’s poor performance in the World Cup 2023, a video of Shakib Al Hasan being pulled, and thrashed by a mob is going viral on the internet. It is being claimed that the Bangladeshi Captain Shakib was mobbed by angry Bangladeshi fans on his return to the country. The viral video was also shared by some media portals claiming that the Bangladeshi skipper was ‘brutally beaten’/ ‘assaulted’ after the team’s World Cup debacle.  Kalesh b/w Bangladeshi Fans and Shakib al hasan, when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign  pic.twitter.com/C7DQK93gAkThis happened to Shakib when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign Bangladeshi people are top tier ret@rds https://t.co/iFDogEkZCA pic.twitter.com/xKkkyfmLFRJournalist Anil Tiwari who writes for Qatari mouthpiece Aljazeera, as per his Twitter bio, tweeted, “Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India’s defeat. Utterly disgraceful behaviour.”Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India's defeat. Utterly disgraceful behavior. #CricketWorldCup #Cricket #Bangladesh  pic.twitter.com/bYY9Cn6xBSHere are some headlines from media portals making those claims alongside sharing the viral video. A Cricket portal named OneCricket headlined (Archive) “[Watch] Shakib Al Hasan Gets ‘Brutally Beaten’ By Bangladesh Fans After Horrific World Cup Run”Notably, Bangladesh performed badly and finished in the eighth spot in the recently concluded World Cup, falling way below the fans’ expectations. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side only managed to win 2 games and the skipper himself had an unforgettable outing. He had to bench himself in some games due to injury concerns. However, the claims being made on the basis of the viral videos are fake. The video doing rounds on the internet is an old video. The said incident involving Shakib Al Hasan captured in the video took place in March this year, that is the video is 8 months old. It is not linked with Bangladesh’s poor performance at the World Cup or Shakib’s below-per-performance. Additionally, the Bangladeshi skipper was not assaulted or mobbed on his return to the country after the team’s World Cup debacle, as claimed on the internet.  The incident took place in Dubai on 16th March when Shakib Al Hasan went for a commercial event at a Jewelry store. After his series against England in March this year, Shakib flew to Dubai to inaugurate a gold jewelry shop that was owned by Arav Khan. Khan is a Bangladeshi fugitive and wanted in the murder case of a police official.At the time of the incident, Shakib was surrounded by fans who went out of control and he tried to rush out. However, in the chaos, he almost fell over while fans kept pulling his collar to stop him and take selfies with him. As seen from the video and confirmed by media reports of that time, he had no security around him to keep fans in check.   Regarding the Dubai incident involving Shakib, the Additional commissioner (detective) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) told the media that the man (Robiul Islam) who uploaded the video is from Bangladesh. The Police official added that Islam had murdered a police officer and had taken an Indian passport. He noted that the accused then went on to live in Dubai and despite knowing his criminal past Shakib went to his event. It is important to note here that Arav Khan’s original name is Robiul Islam. He hails from Kotalipara in Gopalganj and fled the country after charges of murder.The officer added that as part of the investigation, the Bangladeshi Cricket team’s captain might also be quizzed. Sharing reports and details of the original incident, several Twitter users called out the fake claims being made about Shakib Al Hasan. The users slammed individuals and media outlets for peddling these false claims, particularly those who connected the recent setback for Bangladesh with an older video depicting fans pulling his shirt, falsely portraying it as a case of him being manhandled or assaulted while attempting to take a selfie. This footage from Dubai in purposes of business and the audio was taken from a tv DramaOld news pic.twitter.com/NTb3uviioDFAKE NEWS BUSTED !! #ShakibAlHasanhttps://t.co/W7lwtlO2TaI hope you recover from the hated of your own bitrthland.Fake voice alertThis is a 8 months old video from dubai.where he went for promotion and fans wanted to take it photo with him.Crowd went out of control.Such a disgusting thing that it is morphed by a Bangladeshi Kohli fan pic.twitter.com/89qzTQvfsfSome users accused that the fake claims were peddled by Kohli fans in Bangladesh.

On Friday (17th November), a video of a confrontation between two groups was falsely presented as a hate crime against the Sikh community by a Hindu mob.The incident reportedly took place in Jabalpur city of Madhya Pradesh. A Sikh man in a scooter was assaulted by a group of men, the video of which went viral on social media.Prominent fake news peddlers attempted to give a communal spin to the incident. “Sikh was attacked by a Hindu mob…Nobody is safe under BJP ruled government unless he is a BJP supporter,” claimed Islamist X handle ‘RheA’.Another Islamist claimed, “First Muslim, then Dalit and now Sikh.”“Madhya Pradesh – Sikh attacked by Hindu mob in Jabalpur. While raising religious slogans, people badly beat up a person from the Sikh community,” tweeted one ‘mdirfan997’.Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) also amplified the incident and asked the Madhya Pradesh Police to take action.SGPC President Harjinder Singh Dhami has taken notice of a viral video from Jabalpur, in which, a Sikh is seen being assaulted by some men. He said that such an incident of assault with insult to Sikh turban and Kes (unshorn hair) is highly unfortunate and strongly condemnable.… https://t.co/HAVPR9P1D5Contrary to claims on social media, the scuffle took place between a politician (the Sikh man seen in the video) and members of the opposite political party during Vidhan Sabha polling in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. There was no ‘communal angle’ in the incident.Secretary of the Vidarbha Taxpayers Association (VTA), Tejinder Singh Renu, informed, “A video circulated widely on social media (screenshots shared) is from Jabalpur; but it has nothing to do with #Hindu #Sikh enmity.”“Yesterday there were elections in Madhya Pradesh and this incident happened in the Madan Mahal area.

"12 December, 2023 ","Did Washington Post repeat Pakistani conspiracy theory about ‘Disinfo Lab’? Copy-paste journalism, reliance on lunatic who wanted Mamata Banerjee raped, claims about ‘SkinDoctor’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-disinfo-lab-article-on-pakistani-conspiracy-theory/,"Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Aveek Sen's misleading tweets on 'Disinfo Lab' became the primary fodder for both 'Pakistani Defence' and 'The Washington Post'.A day after The Washington Post carried out a hit job on Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, it has come to light that some of the outlandish claims made by the American newspaper bear an uncanny resemblance to conspiracy theories peddled by a Pakistani website.In an attempt to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’, The Washington Post claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.Although it relied on word salad, insinuations, ‘source-based’ allegations and dubious ‘experts’, the American newspaper failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of ‘Disinfo Lab.’Interestingly, a large part of the purported ‘investigation’ by The Washington Post on the Indian OSINT handle appears to be based on conspiracy theories peddled by a website named ‘Pakistan Defence.’In an article titled ‘Disinfo Lab – A Disinformation Project of Indian RA&W’, published by the website in February 2022, a staff writer Amaa’n relied on outlandish claims made by ‘journalist’ Aveek Sen to draw links between ‘Disinfo Lab’ and Indian Intelligence.The ‘Pakistan Defence’ article made references to Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy, Ajayendra Tripathi, and BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga – all of whom appear prominently in the propaganda piece of The Washington Post.The Pakistani website presented the accusations of Aveek Sen, an abusive troll, as the ‘gospel truth.’ In the tweet from 2013 that went viral, Aveek Sen was seen quoting TimesNow, saying that Mamata Banerjee had called the Barasat rapists ‘CPIM supporters’. To that, Aveek Sen had responded saying “Its high time these cpm supporters rape Mamata!”Prior to deleting his account, Aveek Sen had made several dergatory comments targeting women. A few of his archived misogynist tweets can be seen here – In several of his tweets, Aveek Sen was seen referring to women as ‘prostitutes.’Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Sen’s misleading tweets on ‘Disinfo Lab’ became the primary fodder for both ‘Pakistani Defence’ and ‘The Washington Post’. Interestingly, he had also collaborated with the likes of propaganda outlets such as Newslaundry.“And the making of Indian fake disinfo lab, copying the famous eu disinfo lab that exposed hundreds and thousands of fake Indian websites (By author Aveek sen),” read a line from the article on ‘Pakistan Defence.’Coincidentally, a similar language is used in the report published by The Washington Post. “Another person, a former employee, said the Disinfo Lab named and modelled itself after groups such as the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that researches disinformation targeting Europe,” it claimed.It claimed, “Some of the fronts, setup by Colonel Dibya Satpathy, per Aveek Sen’s revelation, include: Root N Wings Media, situated at B-3, Bali’s, Near BSES Office, Arya Samaj Mandir, Lajpat Nagar 2, Delhi. Flat A-20, Lajpat Nagar 3, near Ring Road, Delhi.”Interestingly, the claims made it to the report of The Washington Post as well. “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors working out of a four-story whitewashed building on a leafy street in New Delhi,” the leftist newspaper wrote.In another paragraph, it said, “The office operated under the name Root and Wings Media.” Based on Aveek Sen’s tweets, the shady Pakistani website alleged that Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy had been campaigning against the country on the behest of R&AW and BJP.OpIndia found yet another uncanny resemblance in the report of The Washington Post where it said, “The Disinfo Lab itself was headed by Satpathy, whose work has focused mostly on countering Pakistan.”“The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” the American newspaper claimed in another part of the article.Both The Washington Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ made specific references to ‘Root Wings Media’ and characterised it as a ‘social media marketing company/ campaign agency.’“The company has no more than ten employees, typical of an intelligence front,” the Pakistani website said. And this is what the American newspaper claimed – “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors.” Both The Washingon Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ targeted targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.“Some of the investigative reports published by this website include one aiming to discredit the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,” wrote ‘Pakistan Defence.’“The Disinfo Lab often cites publicly available U.S. lobbying and campaign finance records and produces complex flowcharts to illustrate alleged relationships. But the group draws tenuous connections, claiming, for instance, that a USCIRF commissioner was influenced by Islamists because she once worked on a conservative fundraising committee alongside a lobbyist who went on to represent Muslim American groups,” claimed The Washington Post.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.The Washington Post ensured to not include all conspiracy theories to set its ‘investigative article’ apart from that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ The Pakistani website had even dubbed popular member and dermatologist Neelam Singh aka ‘The Skin Doctor’ as an aide to R&AW officer Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy.“The Evil nexus of Col Dibya Satpathy Indian ex-military intelligence officer and bjp troll farms. To (sic) manufacture and spread propaganda and misinformation with the help of Major Neelam “Neel” Kumari alias “The Skin Doctor”, Major Gaurav Arya,” it claimed.‘Pakistan Defence’ accused ‘The Skin Doctor’ of carrying out the ‘evil nexus’ of supposed ‘Disinfo Lab’ founder and Indian Intelligence officerThe Washington Post did not copy-paste the outrageous claims about ‘Disinfo Lab’ only from ‘Pakistan Defence’ but another Pakistani-based website named ‘Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research (CSCR).Interestingly, CSCR published another misleading piece on ‘Disinfo Lab’ a year before that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ Habitual fake news peddler and anti-Hindu activist CJ Werleman had made similar insinuations about the Indian OSINT handle in February last year.First, the claim of our association with Govt agencies/ RAW. The report is essentially a recycle of previous reports published by Pakistani ISPR/ Info-war machinery. The report is periodically recycled, last by known fake news peddler CJ Werleman.Lazy Journalism!(2/n) pic.twitter.com/0oXNGfrVyoIn November 2021, CJ Werleman had appealed to boycott Indian products to supposedly ‘save’ Muslims in India and Kashmir. Before that, he had tweeted a video of Pramod Muthalik, the chief of the Hindu activist group Shri Rama Sene, to allege that he called for violence against Muslims and the demolition of a mosque in Karnataka. Earlier, he claimed Indians had destroyed a Muslim graveyard in Himachal Pradesh, which was also fake news. In August 2021 when the Islamist group Taliban took over Afghanistan, Werleman was caught spreading Taliban propaganda. In September 2021, he called for ‘regime decapitation’ strikes against India.The Print, run by Shekhar Gupta had eulogised Werleman in a profile describing him as a ‘bigot-turned-crusader against ‘Islamophobia’ who is taking on the Indian state’. Since every anti-India propagandist is a potential source of The Washington Post, there will surely be no dearth of more anti-India hit pieces ahead of the 2024 elections.While hitting out at The Washington Post, ‘Disinfo Lab’ pointed out that the only difference in its article and past hitjobs against it is the addition of unnamed sources. “The only ‘upgrade’ the WaPo did was to make this Pakistani allegation ‘anonymous’. And whatever is in addition to that is again attributed to ‘anonymous’ sources. Hence, literally, every fact claimed is ‘anonymous’. The report has more than 10 anonymous sources,” it added.As pointed out earlier by OpIndia, The Washington Post failed to refute any assertions made by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ It also noted, “While, in their questions to us and other people, WaPo journalists have themselves noted that our claims are factually correct! (thanks for acknowledgement), they alleged that we make ‘tenuous claims’, and cited a few examples.”While calling out the bluff of the leftist newspaper, Disinfo Lab concluded that The Washington Post is overrated. “It is not surprising that people who don’t understand OSINT are baffled by our reporting. It is especially hard for legacy media journos – Indian and foreign alike, who have known journalism only as handouts from sources. Agencies are overrated. OSINT is underrated,” it emphasised.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"12 December, 2023 ",Washington Post and its hit job on ‘Disinfo Lab’: Exposing the nefarious campaign to discredit Indian OSINT handle before 2024 Lok Sabha election,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-hitjob-against-disinfo-lab-anti-india-propaganda-before-2024-elections/,"Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, The Washington Post has launched a campaign of sorts to de-legitimise those exposing anti-India narratives and promote individuals disseminating propaganda against India.On Sunday (10th December), the leftist media outlet carried out a hit job on the Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab.’ To this effect, it published an article titled ‘Covert Indian operation seeks to discredit Modi’s critics in the U.S.’The development comes two days after American political commentator Jack Posobiec revealed how The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Priyanshu Verma had been soliciting information about ‘Disinfo Lab.’‘Disinfo Lab’ is the same OSINT handle, which earlier exposed how the US State Department was relying on misleading data (sourced from Christian evangelist groups and radical Islamist outfits) to allege a decline in India’s religious freedom.It was thus obvious that US-based leftist media outlets such as The Washington Post would make attempts to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’ sooner or later. Based on ‘sources’, Pranshu Verma and his two other colleagues claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Intelligence Officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.The trio at The Washington Post alleged that the objective of ‘Disinfo Lab’ is to ‘research and discredit foreign critics of the Modi government’, ‘combine fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims’, ‘intimidate individuals overseas’ and ‘run covert influence operation.’However, a cursory look at the website of the OSINT handle reveals that it is focused on uncovering disinformation campaigns, aimed at tarnishing the image of India on a global scale. Nevertheless, this did not stop The Washington Post from making sweeping claims about it. “The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” it brazened out.The leftist media outlet roped in several ‘experts’ to suggest that the Indian government led by PM Narendra Modi is using an OSINT handle with 45.6K followers to undermine political rivals and create a global narrative.One such expert was an ‘academic’ named Joyjeet Pal. He claimed, “The Indian right wing is a new player that has arrived on the world stage and wants to shape global discussion…So far, much of it is done in the same way it’s done within India — through crude, blunt force. But it’s getting smarter.” The Washinton Post introduced Pal as a University of Michigan Professor ‘who studies disinformation in India.’ Interestingly, he is the same ‘expert’ whose obscure research was used by Indian leftist propaganda outlet The Wire to discredit calls for investigating the unnatural death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Claim: Raksha Mantri @rajnathsingh admitted on @CNNnews18 that Chinese soldiers crossed Indian side of LACFact: The Minister was referring to differing perceptions of LAC & presence of Chinese troops It is being misinterpreted as if Chinese troops entered Indian side of LAC pic.twitter.com/Xews6Ba1bqAnother controversial expert cited by The Washington Post in its report was ‘journalist’ Ajai Shukla. He claimed, “(The defence establishment) exists to serve national and strategic interests, not political interests. But the BJP under Modi has seen critics as anti-Indian, the enemies of India itself.”Shukla has a history of peddling fake news (here and here) in the context of the India-China border dispute. He had also disseminated conspiracy theories post the 2019 Pulwama terror attack and was dubbed sexist by a prominent Italian journalist. Despite such dwindling credibility, The Washington Post roped him as an expert for its propaganda-laden piece on ‘Disinfo Lab.’India has been under tremendous pressure to choose sides, following the Russia-Ukraine war. The US state apparatus and the media on several occasions had even threatened India with sanctions for purchasing oil from Russia, only to receive befitting replies from External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.Nevertheless, The Washington Post saw it as an opportunity to attack India’s neutral position in the ongoing crisis. “Coordinated social media accounts have been found to play a role, for instance, in spreading identical posts in support of Russia, an important supplier of weapons and energy to India…” it furthered the US State narrative.The leftist news outlet targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.Throughout its article, The Washington Post desperately tried to whitewash both anti-Hindu and anti-India activists and paint them as ‘victims’ of the social media exposé by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ One such activist mentioned by the leftist media outlet happens to be Pieter Friedrich, who has ties to Khalistani terrorist Bhajan Bhinder.“The organization released a dossier nearly 100 pages long alleging that Pieter Friedrich, a California-based activist and journalist who has written magazine articles and given public speeches critical of the BJP and affiliated Hindu-nationalist groups, had ties to the Sikh separatist movement and Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency. The Disinfo Lab burrowed into California state records to uncover Friedrich’s employment history, published his parents’ names and plotted detailed graphs about his social media activity,” it claimed.1) The days of people like Friedrich making threats against non-white people,especially because of the color of their skin, their religious affiliation, or their country of origin must remain behind us.In 2021, OpIndia reported how Pieter Friedrich evolved from a Christian zealot and a Gandhi basher to a ‘critic of Hindu fascism’ and a Khalistani asset. In June last year, he was slammed for allegedly giving death threats to a Hindu US Representative from Illinois, Raja Krishnamoorthi.The Washington Post lamented that ‘Disinfo Lab’, which posted a plethora of evidence tying ‘activist’ Sunita Vishwanath to far-left billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Foundations (OSF), was used against Congress scion Rahul Gandhi.“The Disinfo Lab dug into her past and reported that a nonprofit she launched to help female Afghan refugees had received funding from Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Two months later, after Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi attended a meeting in Washington with Viswanath as part of a U.S. tour, Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP’s social media team, tweeted a photo of the meeting and shared a flowchart stamped with the Disinfo Lab logo illustrating Viswanath’s connections to Soros,” wrote the leftist media outlet.Sunita Vishwanath is the co-founder of an organisation named ‘Women for Afghan Women’, which is funded by OSF. She is also the co-founder of ‘Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr)’ and has tried to create hysteria and panic among Indian Muslims about the National Register of Citizens (NRC).“We are especially appalled by the most recent nightmare of the Kashmiri people, and the situation of 1.9 million people in India who are rendered stateless due to the imposition of the travesty called the National Register of Citizens”, Vishwanath said in 2019. In September 2021, she also participated in the Hinduphobic conference ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva.’ The Washington Post also roped in the policy director of Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr), Ria Chakraborty, to make a case for an organisation named ‘Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC).’➡️IAMC's terror angleIAMC has close ties with terror organizations like SIMI, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-e-Islami.Infact, Mohammad Siddiqi, the founder of SIMI, was once hosted as a guest at IAMC.Research credit – @DisinfoLab pic.twitter.com/iufbOJy9gsAccording to the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), the Indian Americal Muslim Council has links [pdf] with the banned Islamic terror outfit, Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).Besides, the Indian American Muslim Council has ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) through its founder Shaik Ubaid. The IAMC is a Jamat-e-Islami-backed lobbyist organisation claiming to be a rights advocacy group.It had been caught spreading fake news to further the Islamist cause in India. It had also been slapped with the UAPA in 2021.The Washington Post also made references to anti-Brahmin activist Thenmozhi Soundarajan and her organisation ‘Equality Labs’. Soundarajan had shot to fame in 2018 after the then Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey clicked pictures with a poster, designed by her, carrying the tagline ‘Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy.’In April 2022, tech giant Google cancelled a talk by Thenmozhi Soundararajan, owing to the fear that it might create ‘division and rancour’ in the workplace. Google spokesperson Shannon Newberry had said, “We also made the decision to not move forward with the proposed talk which — rather than bringing our community together and raising awareness — was creating division and rancour.”In November last year, she went on an unhinged tirade against Yoga. During the one-and-a-half-hour-long podcast, Soundararajan cast aspersions on the history of the ancient Indian Hindu practice and claimed that it was used by Brahmins to oppress the Dalit community. She also insinuated that Yoga had an in-built system of hierarchy, which supposedly made it vulnerable to abuse.What does it mean to address the structural violence at the heart of yoga? I break the silence on the religious abuse that is at the heart of yoga and how healing begins with debrahminizing and decolonizing. Check it on the latest #conspirituality pod https://t.co/7OadWRA1EP pic.twitter.com/gWgEWCwIv7The Washington Post also attempted to whitewash far-left billionaire George Soros and his nefarious anti-India agenda.The leftist media outlet wrote, “In February, Soros, a frequent critic of Modi, warned in a speech at the Munich Security Conference that the Indian leader was undemocratic and would lose his “stranglehold” over the Indian government. A day later, the Disinfo Lab posted a lengthy tweet thread alleging that Soros had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and manipulated “fake” U.S.-based advocacy groups to smear India. A spokesperson for Soros’s Open Society Foundations called the Disinfo Lab’s claims “entirely baseless” and said they were part of a “campaign by this site and others in India against advocates of human rights, democratic governance and the rule of law in the service of the political aims of the BJP and its allies.”“India has been fighting a ‘perception war’ on all fronts since the start of 2023. On February 16 this year, George Soros exploited the Adani-Hindenburg controversy and launched a scathing attack on the Indian government.He claimed, “Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies. Their fate is intertwined…Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but it failed. Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards.”Soros accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of crony capitalism. “Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament,” he added.The Hungarian-American billionaire also said that the ‘shakedown’ caused to the Indian markets due to the Hindenburg Research report will result in ‘much needed institutional reforms’ and ‘democratic revival’. George Soros and his vicious ecosystem of NGOs, activists and journalists had been trying to prove PM Modi as an ‘electoral autocrat’ who needed to be ousted for the ‘greater good’ of this country. And it has been a work in progress for a long time.The Hungarian-American billionaire has also tried to use international institutions, which are funded by him, including Freedom House and  V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute to tarnish the image of India at a global level.In January 2020, the American billionaire committed $1 billion to start a global university to “fight nationalists” and climate change, calling them twin challenges that threaten the survival of our civilisation.Throughout the article, The Washington Post resorted to insinuations, and source-based allegations to discredit ‘Disinfo Lab.’ However, it failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of the Indian OSINT handle.The leftist news outlet had not refuted the assertion by ‘Disinfo lab’ that its exposé had led to the shutting down of several sources of fake data. “In its response to The Post, the Disinfo Lab pointed to its record of forcing “activists” and “human rights fronts” to shut down by exposing them,” it noted.Ironically, one such source of fake data, DOTO (Data of Database of the Oppressed), was cited by WaPo tech ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma in an article in January 2023 to allege that ‘religious hatred’ is on the rise in India.Turned out DOTO was full of fabrication & outright imagination. We exposed their fabrication, after which they first tried revising their data and later deleted and disappeared.DOTO met its fate in October this year and is no more among us. (RIP!)(12/n) pic.twitter.com/y55TrdzNWS‘Disinfo Lab’ had earlier exposed the fabrications of DOTO, following which the latter first revised and then deleted the database. The OSINT handle also uncovered the lies of another dubious organisation called OFMI (Organization for Minorities of India), following which the latter shut shop permanently.But after our exposé they shut down OFMI, pulled down its website, deleted traces, and went into oblivion. Most of the activists associated with them have also removed all references to OFMI.(6/n) pic.twitter.com/uj0DRlnTkhThe leftist media outlet had reached out to prominent people in the hopes of deterring them from sharing informative posts by ‘Disinfo Lab’. The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma messaged American political commentator Jack Posobiec on Friday (8th December) and claimed that the Indian OSINT handle is run by an Intelligence officer.“We are doing a story on a group called Disinformation Lab. Our reporting shows this group combines fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims to paint U.S. government figures, researchers, Indian American human-rights activists and international humanitarian groups as part of a conspiracy, purportedly led by global Islamic groups and the billionaire George Soros, to undermine India. Our analysis found you have retweeted this organisation’s content,” he claimed. Some guy claiming to be from the Washington Post, just sent me a long text message alleging that I retweeted a post from an Indian intel agency-run media outlet Here’s my response pic.twitter.com/hoQcJ4Gjv0He further added, “Do you know about the organization’s background? Our research has found Disinfo Lab is actually run by an Indian Intelligence Officer. Did you know that?“Pranshu Verma then sought a response from the American political commentator based on his unsubstantiated assertions. “Due to the sensitive nature of this story, the time for response is tight. Please provide a response by the end of day today, Friday, December 8th,” he emphasised.However, he did not anticipate a befitting reply from Jack Posobiec that would put ‘The Washington Post’ in the dock. ” So if it’s a intel agency run-media outlet that basically makes it the same as the Washington Post then?” the American political commentator wrote.Jack Posobiec told Verma that The Washington Post is a media outlet run by the United States Intelligence and by his ‘assertion’ would make it similar to ‘Disinfo Lab.’ As expected, the tech ‘journalist’ did not respond to the message.After the article was published, The Washington Post did not reproduce the actual response of Jack Posobiec. While resorting to shrewd dishonesty, it wrote,” Posobiec did not address whether he was familiar with the organisation’s background.“With the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in mind, The Washington Post is leaving no stone unturned to make insinuations about the Modi government and target individuals and accounts known for debunking anti-India propaganda.The development comes amidst growing concerns about ‘regime change’ operations in India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Just last month, The Washington Post published a misleading piece wherein it dubbed requests for action to X (formerly Twitter) against extemists by Indian government as ‘global standard for online censorship.’Earlier, it romanticised an Islamist named Raqib Hameed Naik in an article titled ‘Tracking rising religious hatred in India, from half a world away.’ A vicious fake news peddler, Raqib Hameed Naik is the founder of anti-Hindu disinformation outlet ‘Hindutva Watch.’He is also infamous for denying the Hindu genocide, perpetrated by radical Islamists in the Kashmir Valley, in the early 1990s. Naik had also mocked the Hindu ‘Shivling’ found inside the Gyanvapi mosque in Kashi.The Washington Post has also published a dubious report on India and its solar power systems. It has given editorial space to the likes of scam-accused ‘journalist’ Rana Ayyub to parrot the narrative of ‘Muslims are in danger in India.’None of these articles are random but serve a sinister agenda to create a narrative that paints the incumbent elected government as ‘anti-democracy’ and ‘anti-minority’.In the US, The Washington Post has attempted to distort public perceptions through its dissemination of the Russian disinformation hoax – A conspiracy theory that suggests that the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 US Presidential election was influenced by Russia.It had also suppressed the ‘Hunter Biden Laptop’ story and influenced the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election. With less than 6 months left for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Indian public must be wary of attempts by Western publications to peddle their sinister agendaWhether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

She was expelled after the tabled report was debated and a vote was sought from MPs. Soon after Mahua Moitra’s expulsion, the left-liberal ecosystem in politics and media started reacting with tears and rants. From BSP MP Danish Ali saying Gandhi must be weeping to so-called neutral journalists getting goosebumps, every reaction from this clout represented the meltdown they had after the action against the now-former TMC MP.Bahujan Samaj Party MP Danish Ali said, “What is this?

All principles of natural justice were clouted. BJP by animal majority voted a member out just because she spoke about industrialist Adani and his relations with Prime Minister Modi.”TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said, “They tried to suppress the voice of opposition. Would not you listen to the one who is accused of so many severe allegations? This never happens. Parties of the I.N.D.I. alliance came together against this decision. It is a huge day for us.”Following the expulsion, Mahua Moitra, known for her tedious and boorish monologues in the parliament, launched another noisy rant outside the Parliament as an ex-MP. Speaking to the media with Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi standing behind her, Mahua Moitra screamed that there was no evidence of any cash or any gifts being taken by her. She even brazened out sharing her login credentials with Darshan Hiranandani, stating that there is no rule specified against sharing login credentials. She then shouted that an MP sharing her credentials with a businessman so that he could pose questions targeted at his rival business entity is not wrong, because MPs are there to raise questions on behalf of the public anyway. Resharing the video of her rant on X, Arfa Khanum Sherwani quoted her sentences and said that she got goosebumps to see Mahua Moitra speak like that. Sherwani posted, “I am 49 years old. I will fight you for the next 30 years. Inside the parliament, and outside on the streets. We are going to come back and we are going to see the end of you. Goosebumps!”I am 49 years old.

ShamefulNotably, Mahua Moitra was given a fair opportunity to present her side in front of the ethics committee of the parliament. However, the left-liberal ecosystem kept spreading the lie that she was denied a chance to defend herself. This is because Mahua Moitra reportedly requested to speak on behalf of her party during the discussion after the report of the committee was tabled in the house, but she was denied.India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai posted from his X handle, “So a 104-page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled. An hour later, the TMC MP is formally expelled by voice vote without being given a chance to speak or any of the MPs having even a chance to read the report in any detail and respond. No cross-examination of key witness Darshan Hiranandani. Natural justice anyone? When the issue is as serious as the expulsion of an MP, surely there is a need for a fair hearing and due process, no?

Musk wrote, “I’m literally rofl rn.” Indian American businessman and GOP Presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy faced an embarrassing moment when he forgot to mute his mic while taking a ‘loo break’ from an active X (Twitter) space. Around 2.3 million listeners were tuned in when Ramaswamy encountered the hot mic moment. On the X (Twitter) Space, Ramaswamy was participating in a discussion on the future of technology. During the session, Elon Musk was explaining the rationale behind reinstating the banned X account of Alex Jones, founder of the website Infowars, back on his micro-blogging platform. However, interjecting in the conversation, Ramaswamy conveyed that he would have to take a short break, hurriedly stating, “Gentlemen, I have to go.” While Elon Musk continued the discussion, the unmistakable sound of running water could be heard in the background.Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy takes a piss with his mic on during an 𝕏 Space with 100K+ listenersElon Musk: “I hope you feel better”Vivek: “I feel great, thank you” pic.twitter.com/3ljslTqnpXPointing towards unusual noises, Alex Jones sarcastically remarked, “Someone’s got their thing open peeing. Somebody’s got their phone in the bathroom.” Responding to Jones’ remark, the host Mario Nawfal alerted Ramaswamy that the source of the noise was his phone. Nawfal said, “Vivek, that’s your phone. But I am not able to mute you.” On returning from the short break, Vivek Ramaswamy realised that his mic was unmuted and understood what had transpired. He immediately apologised for the embarrassing moment. However, on a lighter note, Musk quips, “I hope you feel better now”. To which Ramaswamy replied, “I feel great.

"10 December, 2023 ",Uttar Pradesh: Kashi Vishwanath Dham welcomes record 12.9 crore devotees in 2 years since the inauguration of the temple corridor,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/kashi-vishwanath-dham-welcomes-record-devotees-inauguration-of-temple-corridor/,"Notably, earlier, the temple premises had an area of only 3000 square feet. It was enlarged in 2021 to about 5 lakh square feet. This has allowed a capacity of 50,000 - 75,000 devotees in the temple premises.The Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi has become one of the top pilgrimage spots in India as a record 12.92 crore devotees visited the holy shrine in two years. Notably, the expanded Kashi Vishwanath Dham will soon complete its two years on 13th December. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Dham corridor on 13th December 2021, and since then, the number of devotees of Mahadev has increased manifold. The official added that the number is soon expected to breach the 13 crore mark. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the temple trust, Sunil Kumar Verma said, “Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham was inaugurated on 13 December 2021. From then till 6 December 2023, more than 12 crore, 92 lakh and 24 thousand devotees have taken darshan of Baba. By the end of December, this number is expected to cross 13 crore.”During the auspicious month of Shrawan and other special occasions and festivals, a huge influx of devotees throng the temple premises. As per the official data, during the months of Shrawan alone, more than 1.6 crore devotees visited the temple. This year, because of Adhik maas, the Sawan month was 59 days long. In July, the temple saw a footfall of over 72 lakh devotees and the number increased to 95.6 lakh in August. From January 2023 till 6th December this year, the temple witnessed a total of 5.3 crore devotees.The CEO noted that in the past two years, Kashi Vishwanath Trust has increased the facilities for tourists and devotees. The official added that such changes have made the devotee visits hassle-free. Notably, earlier, the temple premises had an area of only 3000 square feet. It was enlarged in 2021 to about 5 lakh square feet. This has allowed a capacity of 50,000 – 75,000 devotees in the temple premises.According to CEO Sunil Kumar Verma, efficient management is being done in the temple for the convenience of the devotees. Arrangements like German hangers to protect from the scorching sun in summer, cold, and rain, mats to prevent feet from getting burnt, coolers, pure drinking water, free wheelchairs for disabled people in the month of Shrawan, medical treatment for all, etc. have helped the devotees of Shiva. The path to reach the temple has been made easy.Meanwhile, around 10 crore devotees are expected to visit Ayodhya’s Ram Mandir in 2024 after the consecration ceremony by PM Narendra Modi on 22nd January 2024. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"8 December, 2023 ",High priest to lead the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a descendant of priest who presided over the coronation of Chhatrapati...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/know-the-shivaji-connection-of-priest-who-will-lead-ram-temple-consecration/,"More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. 86-year-old Vedic scholar Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit is expected to preside over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January, marking a landmark confluence of heritage and modern relevance. He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",Omidyar decides to shut shop in India after ‘achieving the goal of catalysing impact’: But here’s why its story might not be over,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/omidyar-decides-to-shut-shop-in-india-no-more-new-investments/,"It is pertinent to note that apart from Omidyar, other donors to Forbidden Story include George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF), whose attitude towards the Indian Government is well documented, and Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, which is cloaked in a shroud of secrecy. Omidyar Network India will exit the Indian market by the end of the year 2024 and will not make any new investments in the country, News website Yourstory first reported on 12th December (Tuesday). Omidyar Network is reportedly a self-styled “philanthropic investment firm” comprising a foundation and an impact investment firm. It was established in 2004 by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, a French-born Iranian-American and his wife Pam. In 2019, Omidyar Network India was carved out of its parent entity, the US-based Omidyar Network. The Omidyar Network India, however, will keep following up on deals it had committed earlier, as per sources familiar with the development. Omidyar Group has been active in India since 2010 and has made investments of over $500 million. Out of this nearly $150 million was directed to non-profit investments. It has invested in several startups in India like ZestMoney, DealShare, VerSe (Dailyhunt), Vedantu, 1mg, Bounce, Bijak, Doubtnut, Entri, HealthKart, Indifi, M2P, Pratilipi, and in several media organisations, particularly the leftist portals like Newslaundry. Confirming the development in an internal blog post which was reviewed by YourStory, the firm stated, “After several months of deliberation, it has been decided that Omidyar Network India will stop making new investments and will completely transition out of the market by the end of 2024. Over the next two months, the board and leadership team will assess how best to manage the organisation’s portfolio while recognising the long and trusted partnerships that the Omidyar Network India team has built.” In their statement, Omidyar Network India asserted that it has achieved its primary objective of “catalysing impact” and will not make any new investment. The statement read, “Over the last decade, Omidyar Network India has played a critical role in building the impact investment sector, especially focussed on the Next Half Billion. We are proud of our work in this space, which is now attracting larger pools of capital from local venture capital or impact investors and domestic philanthropists than ever before. Having achieved our primary objective of catalysing impact, Omidyar Network India will not be making any further investments in India.” Conspicuously, Omidyar Network is known for funding many publications, particularly the leftist portals across India including Scroll(dot)in and Newslaundry.Leftist portals like Newslaundry which are under agencies’ scanner for alleged tax evasions and FCRA violations had been receiving funding from Omidyar Network. In September 2021, the Income Tax department carried out a “survey operation” at the office of the website Newslaundry as part of an investigation into the finances and funding of the organisation.Back then, an IT official had said, “NewsClick and Newslaundry received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) at a very high premium while their net worth was very low. There are also gaps in the financials of both the companies, which suggest tax evasion but we are verifying the same.”Newslaundry received funding from the Odimyar Network in 2016, “to expand its reportage and content production teams, leverage its existing content by increasing its exposure to a larger audience, and experiment with new formats of content creation”.Newslaundry’s Editor-in-Chief Madhu Trehan in an email response to The Print confirmed that Omidyar Network has been funding Newslaundry. The email read, “If you look at our website, you can see how much stake Omidyar Network owns in Newslaundry. It is up on our website. The amount raised and equity percentage is on what was then the FIPB website, and that is public information.” According to the Newslaundry website, the majority of the company’s equity is held by its three co-founders, Abhinandan Sekhri, Roopak Kapoor, and Prashant Sareen, and by an impact fund Omidyar Network.  In 2016, the Omidyar Network issued a public statement on its website at the time of investing in Newslaundry. It read, “Our purpose in funding Newslaundry is to invest in a media organisation that is exploring innovative approaches to drive transparency and higher standards throughout the media landscape in India. We also hope that the learnings from Newslaundry’s journey to develop a new business model for independent news production will act as a blueprint for other organisations to follow, develop, and spread.”Meanwhile, Newsclick founder Prabir Purkayastha has been addressing several events organised by organisations that receive funds from abroad, including from the Omidyar Network. As per an India Today report, in its initial years in India, Omidyar Network backed around 25 organisations that deal with news and government transparency. These organisations include News Trust, a news-discovery site run by the nonprofit journalism center, the Poynter Institute; the Sunlight Foundation, dedicated to government transparency; and Transparency & Accountability Initiative, an organisation based in London.In July 2020, Omidyar Network India funded Rs. 10.75 crore for 67 projects under the rapid response funding initiative for COVID-19 across the country. The initiative was launched on 24th March 2020 and it funded organisations like change.org, Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation, and crowdfunding platform Milaap. Another major beneficiary of Omidyar Network is ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms), which also has the Ford Foundation as one of its donors. In January 2019, Regional language news aggregator Dailyhunt raised Rs 24.61 crore in funding from Omidyar Network and Sequoia Capital among others. Additionally, Verse Innovation, the parent company of Dailyhunt and short video platform Josh, also counts Omidyar Network as its investor.Apart from that, in 2019, it came to light that the Omidyar Group was one of the donors to Forbidden Stories (FS), a dubious organisation launched with the underlying aim of effectuating regime changes and installing pliant governments in countries across the world that align with the left-liberal ideology and reinforce the primacy of the Left’s narrative.FS was launched by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Freedom Voices Network. RSF is the same organisation that came up with a dishonest ‘Press Freedom Index‘ to malign India internationally and portray it as a country where journalists are targeted and persecuted for pursuing truth.The Omidyar Group donated to FS through a front organisation Luminate, whose Strategic Plan for 2018-2022 mentioned “Illiberal democracies’ are emerging,” “Civic space is shrinking, and civil society is under attack,” “Rising populism is creating ruptures in historical party politics,” “Insular, nationalist perspectives are resonating with more people,” and “Communities are becoming more polarized among other things.While the strategic plan and its animosity towards nationalism made its ideological orientations abundantly clear, it is important to note that the Omidyar Group funded a host of media organisations worldwide, mostly leftist globalist portals such as Scroll.in. Scroll Media Inc., the operator of the news portal Scroll.in, secured funding from the Omidyar Network in 2014. However, the exact amount of the funding was not disclosed. During that period, Samir Patil, the CEO of Scroll, mentioned, “We cannot disclose the deal size.”Additionally, in 2008, the Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF) had joined hands with Omidyar Network, the Indian School of Business (ISB), and Google.org to launch their 17 million SONG fund to boost investment. Furthermore, Soros’ Foundation and Omidyar Network have also funded $1.3 million to Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), with a long track record of attempts to thrust a biased fact-checking regime on India’s IFCN network.In September 2023, a coalition of 22 groups, including prominent left-wing organisations pledged more than $500 million to fund local media publications in the next five years, according to an announcement.The new coalition named “Press Forward” includes many groups that have left-wing bias based on their funding and initiatives. One of the groups in this alliance is Democracy Fund, an organisation run by left-wing billionaire Pierre Omidyar.According to tax documents obtained by an independent journalist Lee Fang, Democracy Fund reportedly provided a $130,000 grant to the Center for Internet Security to fund a “portal” that was used to flag and censor social media content containing “misinformation” during the 2020 election.It is pertinent to note that apart from Omidyar, other donors to Forbidden Story include George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF), whose attitude towards the Indian Government is well documented, and Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, which is cloaked in a shroud of secrecy. FS also proudly displayed the endorsement by Mediapart’s Head of Investigations Fabrice Afri on its website until recently. Mediapart is the same leftist French organisation that has been peddling propaganda over the Rafale deal. FS has now removed the page “The support us” altogether from its website.Incidentally, in July 2021, the leftist news portal Wire published what it called an ‘explosive story‘ involving allegations of spying with spyware Pegasus. The Wire and its partners were fed the information by two very dubious organisations. One was Amnesty International and the other was Forbidden Stories.In May 2022, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) named the promoters of NGO Omidyar Network and several others including government officials in an FCRA bribery scandal case. The development came after the CBI had filed an FIR regarding a national FCRA funding scam. According to reports, the promoters of NGO Omidyar Network have been under the scanner for allegedly bribing officials to receive FCRA licenses. Additionally, at least 6 to 8 more networks were also under the CBI scanner.Before that, in September 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs had put the Omidyar Network under the FCRA watchlist.In a nutshell, Omidyar Group invested in organisations and efforts that were aimed to dislodge governments and regimes it thought did not align with the “liberal worldview” by bankrolling news organisations, entities, movies, etc that they thought would aid them in building an alternative narrative and challenging the legitimacy of the incumbent governments they did not like. It had been a “catalysing impact” through various organisations that have been cloaked as non-profit, ideologically independent entities but in reality, have been trying to achieve their vested agenda of pliant governments in the host country.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",Smoke canister attack inside Lok Sabha on the anniversary of 2001 Parliament Attack: Who handles the security of Sansad?,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/smoke-canister-attack-inside-lok-sabha-on-anniversary-of-2001-parliament-attack-who-handles-the-security-of-sansad/,"Apart from providing security, Parliament Security Service is also responsible for activities, including guiding visitors through the Parliament House Complex and providing informative sessions on the history of Parliament and its proceedings.The Parliament Security Service manages the security of both houses of the Parliament, Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. It is situated within the Parliament House Complex. It operates under the administrative control of the Joint Secretary (Security) of the Lok Sabha Secretariat and oversees the security operations of both Secretariats.In August 2020, “Unified Operational Command” was established under the Joint Secretary (Security) to enhance the efficiency and coordination among the security personnel. The unified command integrates the security services of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats. Establishing a Unified Operational Command was to ensure uniformity in decision-making processes related to security matters. Notably, the separate Security Services of both houses run simultaneously as their structures are different.Following the tragic terrorist attack on the Parliament House in 2001, the government of India did a comprehensive review of the security arrangements. Subsequent measures were taken to streamline the access points, advanced security gadgets were deployed, and a high-tech access control system was implemented to ensure the safety and security of the MPs and VVIPs. Furthermore, Radio Frequency Tags were introduced to enhance the identification processes and regulate the vehicular movement inside the complex.The Parliament Security Service plays different roles in the complex, including providing security cover to the VVIPs, Members of Parliament, and visitors and conducting anti-sabotage and anti-explosive checks. Other agencies, including Delhi Police, Intelligence Bureau, Parliament Duty Group, Special Protection Group and National Security Guard, coordinate with the Parliament Security Service to ensure smooth operations in the Parliament.Apart from providing security, Parliament Security Service is also responsible for activities, including guiding visitors through the Parliament House Complex and providing informative sessions on the history of Parliament and its proceedings.Parliament Security Service personnel are also deployed for national ceremonies, international conferences, and other events where security is paramount.In a massive security breach in the Parliament, two men jumped into the Lok Sabha well from the visitors’ gallery while the proceedings were going on today, 13 December. After jumping into the well, the two men released some yellow-coloured smoke from canisters. The invasion of the parliament took place on the anniversary of the parliament attack in 2001.Two more people carrying smoke cans were detained outside the parliament. The incident took place at 1 PM during the zero hour in the Lok Sabha, just before the lunch break. When Khagen Murmu, BJP MP from West Bengal, was raising some points regarding his constituency, a commotion was suddenly heard in the background. When the Sansad TV switched to the view of the entire hall, a man could be seen who had already jumped from the gallery and was on the benches. He then started to proceed towards the front of the hall, jumping from bench to bench. People in the Lok Sabah were heard shouting ‘pakdo, pakdo’ (catch him) before the speaker hurriedly adjourned the house. The livestream was cut immediately after that.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"11 December, 2023 ","Mohit Pandey to be the chief priest of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya: While the leftist ecosystem is linking it with caste, here is why...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mohit-pandey-caste-ram-mandir-leftist-ecosystem/,"Many predictable handles, fanning the casteist divide and playing SC, OBC cards, started linking his selection with Brahminism highlighting his name, Manoj Pandey. The process of selecting priests to perform prayers at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was recently completed. As part of the process, regular applications were invited from interested devotees, and around 3000 people participated. The interested parties had to undergo a rigorous selection process that included specific criteria for choosing the priests for the Ram Mandir. In this entire process, 200 applicants were interviewed, out of which 50 candidates were selected for the post of priests.Subsequently, the reports saying that Mohit Pandey had been selected as the chief priest went viral on social media. Reacting to these reports, certain social media users tried to cast aspersions and raise questions over the selection process for priests asking why only a Brahmin was selected for this post.Many predictable handles, fanning the casteist divide and playing SC, OBC cards, started linking his selection with Brahminism highlighting his name, Manoj Pandey. A Dalit portal named ‘The Mooknayak’ tweeted in Hindi, ” Mohit Pandey will become the priest of Ram temple! Is it forbidden for Dalits to become priests?” ""राम मंदिर के पुजारी बनेंगे मोहित पांडे!""– क्या दलितों का पुजारी बनना मना है? pic.twitter.com/aZRstoJcA0Dilip Mandal fumed and wrote, “This temple is being built by the Government of India as a trust. It is not anyone’s ancestral property. There should be an agitation if the reservation is not given in the temple management. Everyone will give Dakshina and only one caste will withdraw all the money, this will not work.” बहुत सही। वैसे भी ये मंदिर भारत सरकार का ट्रस्ट बना रहा है। किसी के बाप की संपत्ति नहीं है। मंदिर मैनेजमेंट में रिज़र्वेशन न दिया गया तो आंदोलन होना चाहिए। दक्षिणा सब देंगे और सिर्फ सारा पैसा एक जाति के लोग निकालेंगे, ये नहीं चलेगा। https://t.co/Rp2qUwV6BeAn X user named Suraj Yadav in a sarcastic tone claimed that Dalits, OBCs, and Tribals are not Hindus. He wrote, “If he is a Hindu then he is selected. Keep in mind that Dalits, backward people, and tribals are not Hindus. Shudras, Ati Shudras, and people outside the caste system have no place either in the trust or in the place of worship. And this is especially for those Yadavs who are supporters of Manuvad or Brahminism.”हिन्दू है तो चयनित हुआ। दलित, पिछड़े, आदिवासी हिन्दू नहीं हैं, यह ध्यान रहे। शूद्र, अति शूद्र, जाति प्रथा से बाहर लोगों को न तो ट्रस्ट में स्थान है और न ही पूजा स्थल में। और यह उन यादवों के लिए ख़ास तौर से जो मनुवाद या ब्राह्मणवाद के समर्थक हैं। #SC_ST_OBC #ईवीएम_हटाओ… pic.twitter.com/RadVOwhiK9However, the pertinent thing is that those who are casting aspersions, neither know about the selection process nor are they aware of the merit due to which Mohit Pandey was selected for the post of Chief Priest.For those unversed, the necessary condition to become a priest in the Ramlala temple was that the candidate should have studied Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit from a recognised Gurukul. Additionally, the candidate must have been initiated into the Ramanandiya tradition. In line with that, attention was paid to the knowledge of Vedas, rituals, and Vedic mantras during the interview process to select priests for the Ram Mandir. The upper limit for the candidates was fixed at 30 years.Furthermore, despite their selection as Priest and Chief Priest, the selected candidates will have to undergo a long training period, which would last for 6 months, before they start performing their duties. In this training phase, they will be imparted in-depth knowledge of Vedas, rituals, Vedic mantras, and Ramayana. Only after the training phase is over, the priests will be able to perform the worship of Ramlala.As per the selection criteria, it was necessary to be a scholar of the Ramnandiya tradition, as well as to have expertise in the knowledge of Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit. The fact that Mohit Pandey passed all the selection criteria based on merit and ability, just like other candidates who were also evaluated, means that allegations of casteism and religious favoritism don’t arise. Notably, Mohit Pandey studied for seven years at Dudheshwar Ved Vidyapeeth, Ghaziabad. He obtained a Shastri (Bachelor) degree from Sri Venkateswara Vedic University, affiliated with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams in Tirupati. In 2023, he earned a master’s degree in Samaveda. He is also a scholar of the Ramanandiya tradition and possesses expertise in Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit.Likewise, other selected priests include youth from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. All the selected priests belong to the Ramanandiya tradition and have expertise in the Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit.Speaking with The New Indian Express, Professor Rani Sadashiva Murthy, Vice-Chancellor of Sri Venkateswara Vedic University expressed happiness over the selection of Mohit Pandey to the post of Chief Priest of Shri Ram Lal Temple. Murthy said, “Many students from the University serve as priests and acharyas in various temples. A soft-spoken person, Pandey’s nature, focus and dedication to his studies have earned him the opportunity to serve Lord Ram in the esteemed Ayodhya Ram mandir.”Mohit Pandey’s journey, from Ghaziabad to Tirupati and now Ayodhya after being selected as the Chief Priest of Ram Lala, is a testament to his dedication and rigorous training. Institutions like Dudheshwar Ved Vidyapeeth and Sri Venkateswara Vedic University in Ghaziabad have played a crucial role in nurturing individuals with spiritual abilities, as evidenced by their selection process.In such a situation, those who are pointing fingers at his selection and linking it with castism are vitiating society by fanning the caste divide. While the ecosystem has been carrying out smear campaigns and cast aspersions, it is important to highlight that there are several temples in different states of India, there are not only Dalit or Women priests, prayers are performed by Dalit women priests in these temples.In a previous article, OpIndia highlighted temples in which women and Dalits have been performing the responsibility of priests.

"10 December, 2023 ","Old video of Bengali singer, highlighting selective outrage of Muslims, goes viral: Read details",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/old-clipped-viral-video-muslim-hypocrisy-poem-hindus-in-bangladesh/,"While concluding the first stanza, Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions how the Muslim community in Bangladesh can live with such glaring double-standards.A week ago, a video of a woman highlighting the silence of Bangladeshi Muslims over the atrocities committed against Hindus in the Islamic Republic went viral on X (formerly Twitter).A user named ‘SK Chakraborty(@sanjoychakra)’ posted the video on the micro-blogging platform on 3rd December, which had since garnered 1.79 lakh views. The video was shared over 1800 times and was liked by 3500 users.‘Sk Chakraborty’ informed that he did not know about the identity of the woman, who had conveyed the pain of the Hindu community and the hypocrisy of militant Muslims in the form of a melodious poem. This gutsy H woman in her melodius voice sings about Hindu oppression bringing out the pain of Hindus and hypocricy of M. Militant M.. are inciting communal riots across Facebook. She shouldn’t face the fate of Kanhaiyalal.Rough translation- “Free loader, son of M. Your tears… pic.twitter.com/Rwdr2iF8eXWith the help of our sources, OpIndia was able to ascertain the identity of the woman as Indian Bengali singer Mousumi Hossain. She is a native of Barasat, located in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. At the time of writing, Mousumi had 7.1K followers on Facebook. After closely listening to the lyrics in the video, OpIndia was able to find a transcript of the poem that was uploaded on the website ‘Kobita Cocktail in 2019. The name of the poet was mentioned as Akhtaruzzaman Azad.We found that Azad is a Dhaka-based author and has more than 1.12 lakh followers on Facebook. It became clear that he indeed wrote the poem in the context of Bangladesh, although Indian singer Mousumi Hossain featured in the viral video. On further digging into the matter, OpIndia was able to trace the video on the timeline of Akhtaruzzaman Azad. The video was posted on 29th June last year.In the caption, the poet informed that the name of the poem is ‘Awoj Abar Tolo’ which loosely translates to ‘Raise Your Voice now.’ The poem deals with the subject of religious extremism and selective outrage by various religious denominations (Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists). Each stanza, barring the last and penultimate, is dedicated to the antics of followers of each Faith.The poet Akhtaruzzaman Azad calls upon society to shed religious differences, stop the bloodshed and see the goodness in one another. The poem has been recited like a song by singer Mousumi Hossain. It must be mentioned that only the first stanza of the poem (and not the entirety of it), concerning the hypocrisy of Muslims living in Bangladesh, has been going viral on social media.In that particular stanza, the poet highlights how believers in Allah (Mumin) are willing to cry their hearts out on learning about murders in Palestine or the plight of Rohingyas in Myanmar. He emphasises how Muslims are ever-ready to wail about ‘saving Gaza’ but have no tears to shed for Hindus dying in Bangladesh. The poem brings out the distinction in this selective ‘concern for humanity.’ –In the first stanza, the poet highlights how the Muslim community screams over the death of someone named ‘Malik or Khalik ‘ but does not even whisper for a deceased named ‘Naresh or Paresh’.While concluding the first stanza, Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions how the Muslim community in Bangladesh can live with such glaring double-standards. He talks about the behavioural patterns of followers of other Faiths such as Hinduism, Christianity and Buddhism in the second, third and fourth stanzas.In the end, he the poet makes an appeal for peace among different factions of the society.Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the 1-year-old video is going viral on social media. Given that the poem by Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions the selective silence of the Muslim community in Bangladesh (in the first stanza), which perfectly fits a pattern in the Islamic world, it is gaining traction among netizens. বাংলাদেশে বিবেক এখনো বেঁচে আছে। আমার প্রণাম নিন। আখতারুজ্জামান আজাদের কবিতা–""এই যে তুমি মস্ত মুমিন, মুসলমানের ছেলে;বক্ষ ভাসাও, ফিলিস্তিনে খুনের খবর পেলে।রোহিঙ্গাদের দুঃখে তুমি এমন কাঁদা কাঁদো;ভাসাও পুরো আকাশ-পাতাল, ভাসাও তুমি চাঁদও!অশ্রু তোমার তৈরি থাকে— স্বচ্ছ এবং তাজা;Ex-Governor of Meghalaya, Tathagatha Roy, shared the poem on X (formerly Twitter) on 1st November, 2023.The video is equally popular on Facebook amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","Gujarat: AAP MLA Bhupat Bhayani resigns, says ‘AAP not a proper platform to work for country’; speculations of two more MLAs leaving the party",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/gujarat-aap-mla-bhupat-bhayani-resigns-set-to-join-bjp-again/,"Bhupat Bhayani said that only due to nationalist ideology, he decided to leave the Aam Aadmi Party and has taken this decision after discussing it with the people of his constituency.In Gujarat, the Aam Aadmi Party suffered a major setback before the Lok Sabha elections. AAP MLA Bhupat Bhayani resigned from the party and the post of MLA on Wednesday (13th December). He has said that he is leaving the Aam Aadmi Party due to nationalist ideology. The speaker of the Gujarat state assembly has accepted Bhayani’s resignation.Bhupat Bhayani said that only due to nationalist ideology, he decided to leave the Aam Aadmi Party and has taken this decision after discussing it with the people of his constituency. It has been only one year since the assembly elections. The MLA’s exit has also dealt a major blow to AAP’s preparations for the Lok Sabha elections. On Wednesday at 10:45 AM, Bhayani handed in his resignation to the Assembly Speaker, Shankar Chaudhary. The Speaker announced that Bhayani personally delivered his resignation today, and it was duly accepted.The Aam Aadmi Party is preparing to contest elections in Gujarat under the I.N.D.I. alliance. Bhupat Bhayani said that he was earlier in the BJP and was associated with the ideology of nationalism. He said that he was going to leave the Aam Aadmi Party and join the BJP only because of the ideology of nationalism.Bhayani said, “I cannot be against PM Modi and I belong to nationalist ideology. That is why I have decided to leave the Aam Aadmi Party. Aam Aadmi Party is not the appropriate platform to work in the interest of the country.” Although he did not clarify when he would join the BJP, he accepted that he would join the party for sure. He said that if the party wants, he will contest the election once again.Bhupat Bhayani, a BJP member for 14 years, joined the Congress and won the 2017 elections. Then he made a surprising shift to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) just before the 2022 elections. Winning a seat as an MLA from Visavadar on the AAP ticket, he faced talks of resignation within a week of his victory. Initially, he deferred the decision, stating that he would consult with the people in his constituency before concluding. However, a year later, he decided to step down from his legislative position. This resignation has once again disrupted the functioning of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly. Throughout the past few decades, the assembly has not consistently retained its full complement of 182 legislators, with disruptions occurring due to various factors such as the passing of a legislator or changes in political affiliations.AAP state president Isudan Gadhvi has said in his first reaction that the BJP is running a dictatorship, and forcing MLAs to resign. He said that the BJP is afraid of Aam Aadmi Party.Currently, only four AAP legislators remain in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly, and they may also encounter challenges in the run-up to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. It is speculated that 2 more MLAs from the Aam Aadmi Party may also resign. According to a report by Divya Bhaskar, after the resignation of Bhupat Bhayani, now Botad MLA Umesh Makwana and Gariadhar MLA Sudhir Vaghani can also resign. The report said that MLA Makwana will make an official announcement soon.According to a report by Zee 24 Kalak, Sudhir Vaghani is also unhappy with the party and can leave the party at any time. But in a conversation with TV9, Sudhir Vaghani denied these claims and said that he was not resigning. There was no statement from Umesh Makwana in this regard.AAP MLA, Sudhir Vaghani denied leaving the party, criticizing #BhupatBhayani's action #Gujarat #TV9News pic.twitter.com/oxU5Wp17jfSimilar claims are being made in many other reports and it is being said that two more AAP MLAs may resign. It is also being speculated that all the MLAs of the Aam Aadmi Party will leave the party before the Lok Sabha elections. There is also talk of the resignation of a Congress MLA.The Aam Aadmi Party won only five seats in the Gujarat Assembly elections while losing deposits in 128 seats. The five seats are Botad, Gariadhar, Visavadar, Jamjodhpur and Dediapada. The MLA of Visavadar has already resigned. It is said that the MLAs of Gariadhar and Botad may also resign. Meanwhile, Chaitar Vasava, the MLA from Dediapada, has been absconding for several weeks in connection with assaulting forest department workers.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",Uttar Pradesh: Blasphemy case filed against a Muslim student of AMU-run school for allegedly insulting Prophet Muhammad,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/up-muslim-pupil-beaten-suspended-for-offensive-remarks-against-prophet/,"The student was suspended from the Senior Secondary School for Boys which is run by the Aligarh Muslim University An 18-year-old Muslim student in class 12 from Bijnor was assaulted by other Muslim residents of a hostel on the campus of Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh after he was accused of uttering offensive remarks about the Prophet Muhammad as well as sharing the same on social media. The incident transpired on 12th December in Aligarh’s Civil Lines Police Station area.A First Information Report was registered against him and cops have initiated a probe into the matter. Furthermore, he was suspended from the Senior Secondary School for Boys which is run by the university. According to the complainant who is of Kasgand and is a pupil in the varsity, the boy has a history of passing similar statements against Islam and is anti-Muslim. The complainant told OpIndia in an interview that the accused student has a habit of making comments against the Prophet.The complaint stated that the former along with some of his acquaintances was present in the Allama Iqbal Hostel of AMU when the offender arrived there and began speaking disparaging and inappropriate things about Islam and its prophet. It is reported that he began using derogatory words after the complainant stopped him and announced, “Do whatever you can, I will continue to say all this.” The complainant claimed that the remarks had offended his religious sentiments.Strict action has been demanded against the culprit after a case has been launched under sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) based on the complaint. OpIndia has a copy of the FIR.The complainant and his colleagues beat up the accused in the name of blasphemy, per several media accounts. However, the former countered that these charges were unfounded while talking to OpIndia. He alleged to have all of the hostel’s CCTV footage as evidence. He responded with a “No” when inquired whether there was any proof of insult to Prophet Muhammed by the student. Notably, AMU Deputy Proctor S Ali Nawaz Zaidi revealed that the pupil was attacked by the claimant and his aides. “The student was suspended with immediate effect and an inquiry has been ordered into his objectionable posts. Till the completion of the probe, he will remain suspended. Hostel inmates thrashed the student after locking him in a room last evening and forced him to delete the post. The student ran out of the hostel and was saved by security personnel,” he mentioned. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",‘Don’t make us reactivate earlier order of attaching Delhi ad budget’: SC warns Kejriwal govt of tough action for not releasing funds for RRTS...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/sc-warns-kejriwal-govt-of-diverting-deljis-ad-budget-if-it-does-note-release-fund-for-rrts-project/,"The Supreme Court then gave 7 days to the Delhi government to release the funds for the project, asking it to strictly follow the schedule of investmentOn 13th December (Wednesday), the Supreme Court issued a stern warning to Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal government over the delay in providing funds for the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS). The court observed that the Delhi government should refrain from compelling the court to pass ‘tough orders’. The bench noted that if the Delhi government doesn’t pay its share of dues for the project, it will be forced to reactivate the earlier order and attach the AAP government’s advertisement budget.  Notably, in November this year, Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Sudhanshu Dhulia directed that if the Delhi government fails to allocate funds for the Rapid Rail project, the amount will be redirected from the Arvind Kejriwal government’s advertisement budget for the current year.During the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had observed that the problem was that the Delhi government could make a budgetary provision of Rs 580 crore for advertisements but it could not make a budgetary provision of Rs 400 crore as part of its share for the vital infrastructure project.Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had said, “If such national projects are affected, and if money is being spent on advertising, we would be inclined to ask the money to be directed to the infrastructure”.Pertinently, the Supreme Court was apprised today that the Delhi government has still not paid its share for the RRTS project during the ongoing hearing on pleas concerning air pollution in Delhi. Adv: The Delhi government has still not paid (its share of RRTS).Sr Adv S Muralidhar for Delhi government: The minute the government of India (officially) approves the project, we will release these funds. NCRTC website says Centre has not.#SupremeCourtResponding to the charges, the Delhi government’s counsel Senior Advocate S Muralidhar defended the delay in funding. Muralidhar argued that the Delhi government will release these funds when the government of India officially approves the project. He claimed that the NCRTC website says the Centre has not done it, adding that Delhi-Alwar and Delhi-Panipat Corridor projects are yet to be approved by the Centre. The advocate claimed that Delhi govt has made budgetary provisions for the projects, and the funds will be released after the projects are approved.In reply, the bench warned, “These are new excuses (smiles). We are not afraid to pass tough orders. If you do not pay why will even other States pay.” The court also noted that other states have released their share of the funds, and therefore the Delhi govt also should do the same.The opposing counsel pointed out that these projects are sanctioned through international plans and delays escalate the cost. SC: Mr Muralidhar you will make me reactivate my earlier order (of attaching Delhi ad budget).#SupremeCourtThe bench stated, “Mr Muralidhar you will make me reactivate my earlier order (of attaching Delhi ad budget).” The Supreme Court then gave 7 days to the Delhi government to release the funds for the project. The court strictly directed the state govt to abide by the schedule concerning the allocation of funds for this project.Meanwhile, earlier on Monday (11th December), the Supreme Court had slammed the Delhi government over its ‘lackadaisical approach’ towards providing funds to the Delhi High Court and district judiciary for infrastructure development.The bench was headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and included Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra. The bench said, “What is happening? What is your government doing? You don’t want to give any funds to the Delhi High Court? We need approval by Thursday. It is a model High Court and look at the condition. Judges are undergoing training and there are no courtrooms.” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",Omidyar decides to shut shop in India after ‘achieving the goal of catalysing impact’: But here’s why its story might not be over,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/omidyar-decides-to-shut-shop-in-india-no-more-new-investments/,"It is pertinent to note that apart from Omidyar, other donors to Forbidden Story include George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF), whose attitude towards the Indian Government is well documented, and Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, which is cloaked in a shroud of secrecy. Omidyar Network India will exit the Indian market by the end of the year 2024 and will not make any new investments in the country, News website Yourstory first reported on 12th December (Tuesday). Omidyar Network is reportedly a self-styled “philanthropic investment firm” comprising a foundation and an impact investment firm. It was established in 2004 by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, a French-born Iranian-American and his wife Pam. In 2019, Omidyar Network India was carved out of its parent entity, the US-based Omidyar Network. The Omidyar Network India, however, will keep following up on deals it had committed earlier, as per sources familiar with the development. Omidyar Group has been active in India since 2010 and has made investments of over $500 million. Out of this nearly $150 million was directed to non-profit investments. It has invested in several startups in India like ZestMoney, DealShare, VerSe (Dailyhunt), Vedantu, 1mg, Bounce, Bijak, Doubtnut, Entri, HealthKart, Indifi, M2P, Pratilipi, and in several media organisations, particularly the leftist portals like Newslaundry. Confirming the development in an internal blog post which was reviewed by YourStory, the firm stated, “After several months of deliberation, it has been decided that Omidyar Network India will stop making new investments and will completely transition out of the market by the end of 2024. Over the next two months, the board and leadership team will assess how best to manage the organisation’s portfolio while recognising the long and trusted partnerships that the Omidyar Network India team has built.” In their statement, Omidyar Network India asserted that it has achieved its primary objective of “catalysing impact” and will not make any new investment. The statement read, “Over the last decade, Omidyar Network India has played a critical role in building the impact investment sector, especially focussed on the Next Half Billion. We are proud of our work in this space, which is now attracting larger pools of capital from local venture capital or impact investors and domestic philanthropists than ever before. Having achieved our primary objective of catalysing impact, Omidyar Network India will not be making any further investments in India.” Conspicuously, Omidyar Network is known for funding many publications, particularly the leftist portals across India including Scroll(dot)in and Newslaundry.Leftist portals like Newslaundry which are under agencies’ scanner for alleged tax evasions and FCRA violations had been receiving funding from Omidyar Network. In September 2021, the Income Tax department carried out a “survey operation” at the office of the website Newslaundry as part of an investigation into the finances and funding of the organisation.Back then, an IT official had said, “NewsClick and Newslaundry received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) at a very high premium while their net worth was very low. There are also gaps in the financials of both the companies, which suggest tax evasion but we are verifying the same.”Newslaundry received funding from the Odimyar Network in 2016, “to expand its reportage and content production teams, leverage its existing content by increasing its exposure to a larger audience, and experiment with new formats of content creation”.Newslaundry’s Editor-in-Chief Madhu Trehan in an email response to The Print confirmed that Omidyar Network has been funding Newslaundry. The email read, “If you look at our website, you can see how much stake Omidyar Network owns in Newslaundry. It is up on our website. The amount raised and equity percentage is on what was then the FIPB website, and that is public information.” According to the Newslaundry website, the majority of the company’s equity is held by its three co-founders, Abhinandan Sekhri, Roopak Kapoor, and Prashant Sareen, and by an impact fund Omidyar Network.  In 2016, the Omidyar Network issued a public statement on its website at the time of investing in Newslaundry. It read, “Our purpose in funding Newslaundry is to invest in a media organisation that is exploring innovative approaches to drive transparency and higher standards throughout the media landscape in India. We also hope that the learnings from Newslaundry’s journey to develop a new business model for independent news production will act as a blueprint for other organisations to follow, develop, and spread.”Meanwhile, Newsclick founder Prabir Purkayastha has been addressing several events organised by organisations that receive funds from abroad, including from the Omidyar Network. As per an India Today report, in its initial years in India, Omidyar Network backed around 25 organisations that deal with news and government transparency. These organisations include News Trust, a news-discovery site run by the nonprofit journalism center, the Poynter Institute; the Sunlight Foundation, dedicated to government transparency; and Transparency & Accountability Initiative, an organisation based in London.In July 2020, Omidyar Network India funded Rs. 10.75 crore for 67 projects under the rapid response funding initiative for COVID-19 across the country. The initiative was launched on 24th March 2020 and it funded organisations like change.org, Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation, and crowdfunding platform Milaap. Another major beneficiary of Omidyar Network is ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms), which also has the Ford Foundation as one of its donors. In January 2019, Regional language news aggregator Dailyhunt raised Rs 24.61 crore in funding from Omidyar Network and Sequoia Capital among others. Additionally, Verse Innovation, the parent company of Dailyhunt and short video platform Josh, also counts Omidyar Network as its investor.Apart from that, in 2019, it came to light that the Omidyar Group was one of the donors to Forbidden Stories (FS), a dubious organisation launched with the underlying aim of effectuating regime changes and installing pliant governments in countries across the world that align with the left-liberal ideology and reinforce the primacy of the Left’s narrative.FS was launched by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Freedom Voices Network. RSF is the same organisation that came up with a dishonest ‘Press Freedom Index‘ to malign India internationally and portray it as a country where journalists are targeted and persecuted for pursuing truth.The Omidyar Group donated to FS through a front organisation Luminate, whose Strategic Plan for 2018-2022 mentioned “Illiberal democracies’ are emerging,” “Civic space is shrinking, and civil society is under attack,” “Rising populism is creating ruptures in historical party politics,” “Insular, nationalist perspectives are resonating with more people,” and “Communities are becoming more polarized among other things.While the strategic plan and its animosity towards nationalism made its ideological orientations abundantly clear, it is important to note that the Omidyar Group funded a host of media organisations worldwide, mostly leftist globalist portals such as Scroll.in. Scroll Media Inc., the operator of the news portal Scroll.in, secured funding from the Omidyar Network in 2014. However, the exact amount of the funding was not disclosed. During that period, Samir Patil, the CEO of Scroll, mentioned, “We cannot disclose the deal size.”Additionally, in 2008, the Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF) had joined hands with Omidyar Network, the Indian School of Business (ISB), and Google.org to launch their 17 million SONG fund to boost investment. Furthermore, Soros’ Foundation and Omidyar Network have also funded $1.3 million to Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), with a long track record of attempts to thrust a biased fact-checking regime on India’s IFCN network.In September 2023, a coalition of 22 groups, including prominent left-wing organisations pledged more than $500 million to fund local media publications in the next five years, according to an announcement.The new coalition named “Press Forward” includes many groups that have left-wing bias based on their funding and initiatives. One of the groups in this alliance is Democracy Fund, an organisation run by left-wing billionaire Pierre Omidyar.According to tax documents obtained by an independent journalist Lee Fang, Democracy Fund reportedly provided a $130,000 grant to the Center for Internet Security to fund a “portal” that was used to flag and censor social media content containing “misinformation” during the 2020 election.It is pertinent to note that apart from Omidyar, other donors to Forbidden Story include George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF), whose attitude towards the Indian Government is well documented, and Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, which is cloaked in a shroud of secrecy. FS also proudly displayed the endorsement by Mediapart’s Head of Investigations Fabrice Afri on its website until recently. Mediapart is the same leftist French organisation that has been peddling propaganda over the Rafale deal. FS has now removed the page “The support us” altogether from its website.Incidentally, in July 2021, the leftist news portal Wire published what it called an ‘explosive story‘ involving allegations of spying with spyware Pegasus. The Wire and its partners were fed the information by two very dubious organisations. One was Amnesty International and the other was Forbidden Stories.In May 2022, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) named the promoters of NGO Omidyar Network and several others including government officials in an FCRA bribery scandal case. The development came after the CBI had filed an FIR regarding a national FCRA funding scam. According to reports, the promoters of NGO Omidyar Network have been under the scanner for allegedly bribing officials to receive FCRA licenses. Additionally, at least 6 to 8 more networks were also under the CBI scanner.Before that, in September 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs had put the Omidyar Network under the FCRA watchlist.In a nutshell, Omidyar Group invested in organisations and efforts that were aimed to dislodge governments and regimes it thought did not align with the “liberal worldview” by bankrolling news organisations, entities, movies, etc that they thought would aid them in building an alternative narrative and challenging the legitimacy of the incumbent governments they did not like. It had been a “catalysing impact” through various organisations that have been cloaked as non-profit, ideologically independent entities but in reality, have been trying to achieve their vested agenda of pliant governments in the host country.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","‘If an email was sent, I would have looked at it right away’, CJI tells Mahua Moitra, assures to look into the listing of...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/cji-chandrachud-tells-mahua-moitra-to-email-assures-listing-plea-against-expulsion-quickly/,"CJI assured the senior advocate that he would look into the listing aspect at lunch during the day. ""The matter may not have been registered... If an email was sent, then I would look at it right away. Please send it,"" the CJI said. Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud on Wednesday assured Trinamool Congress Party (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra that he would look into the listing of her plea against her expulsion from Lok Sabha in a cash-for-query case. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Moitra, mentioned before a bench headed by CJI the plea of Moitra for urgent listing. CJI assured the senior advocate that he would look into the listing aspect at lunch during the day. “The matter may not have been registered… If an email was sent, then I would look at it right away. Please send it,” the CJI said. Earlier in the day, Singhvi mentioned the plea before a bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul who asked him to mention it before the CJI. Justice Kaul said, “Let CJI decide.. I cannot decide it at this stage.” Justice Kaul is retiring on December 25. Moitra approached the top court, challenging her expulsion from the Lok Sabha. Moitra was on Friday expelled from the Lok Sabha after a discussion on the report of the Ethics Committee in the ‘cash for query’ that was tabled in the Lower House. Moitra, who was not allowed to speak during the discussion inside the House, said that the Ethics committee broke every rule. The expelled Lok Sabha MP alleged that she has been found guilty of breaching a code of ethics that ‘does not exist’. Moitra further alleged that the findings are solely based on the written testimonies of two private citizens whose versions contradict each other in material terms and her right to cross-examine them was snatched. “None of whom I was allowed to cross-examine. One of the two private citizens is my estranged partner, who with malafide intention, masqueraded as a common citizen in front of the committee. The two testimonies have been used to hang me there at polar opposites to each other,” she said. The Ethics Committee report probing ‘Unethical Conduct’ of the TMC MP had recommended that Moitra “may be expelled” from the Lok Sabha and called for an “intense, legal, institutional inquiry” by the central government in a “time-bound manner”. The report was adopted by a 6:4 majority in the panel last month. The report on Moitra’s cash-for-query case revealed that she visited the UAE four times from 2019 to 2023 while her login was accessed several times. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"13 December, 2023 ","Mumbai-based real estate company to invest Rs 1,200 crores for projects in Ayodhya: How Ram Mandir is boosting economy in UP’s temple town",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mumbai-based-real-estate-company-to-invest-rs-1200-crores-for-projects-in-ayodhya/,"Mumbai-based real estate company The House of Abhinandan Lodha has invested nearly ₹300 crore in acquiring a 25-acre land parcel in Ayodhya and has laid out a plan to launch a plotted development project in January 2024.From resistance to reclamation, Ayodhya the holy city in Uttar Pradesh has witnessed numerous changes over the years. The city known for its narrow lanes has now emerged as a major destination for real-estate investors. This comes ahead of the consecration ceremony of the Shri Ram Mandir on January 22 next year. In this line, Mumbai-based real estate company The House of Abhinandan Lodha has invested nearly ₹300 crore in acquiring a 25-acre land parcel in Ayodhya and has laid out a plan to launch a plotted development project in January 2024.The project is situated approximately 12 to 15 minutes from the Shri Ram Temple. According to Samujjwal Ghosh, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), HOABL, the company expects to invest roughly 1200 crore over three to four years that is by December 2026. Ghosh told HT that HOABL is planning to launch 200-250 plots in Ayodhya the next year. These plots are estimated to cost around Rs 1.8 crore plus taxes for a 1250 sq ft plot.As the inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is nearing, the spiritual town is undergoing a real estate boom and transforming into a major centre of spiritual tourism. According to real estate agents, with multiple investors from around the country and even overseas vying for fewer land parcels, property values have skyrocketed, in some cases four to ten times what they were around four to five years back.According to reports, the government has approved the development of various townships and private hotels in the city. These lots are near the Chaudah Kosi Parikrama, the Ring Road, and the Lucknow-Gorakhpur Highway. The Ayodhya Development Authority intends to present a plotted housing scheme spanning 80 acres of land by the end of 2023. Between April and November of this year, up to 29,325 sale deeds were registered in Ayodhya, with land transactions accounting for 80 per cent of the total,  as per Stamp and Registration department estimates. Local real estate dealers underscore that land costs were about one-fourth of how much they are now before the 2019 Supreme Court decision that paved the way for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.Parasuram Mishra, a broker at Shri Balaji Ayodhya Property told the Hindustan Times that prices of land within a radius of 5-10 km of the temple have increased much more. The rates range from Rs 2000 per sq ft to as high as Rs 18,000 per sq ft adding that commercial plots start at around ₹4000 per sq ft depending on the location.Reports say that the state’s Stamp and Registration Department’s revenue has increased to Rs 15,631.33 lakh as of November this year, up from roughly Rs 10,000 lakh in 2018-19. The Department’s revenue receipts increased by 109% in November, making it the highest in the state.With skyrocketing investments in the sacred land, the influx of tourists ahead of and after the consecration of Ram Mandir will surge. This would open doors for employment and business opportunities for the local people.In addition to the real estate sector, the hotel chains rushing to Ayodhya are also hopeful of raking in huge profits with the tourism boom in the city. As the state government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the Centre are undertaking around 264 projects worth about Rs 32,000 crore, including highways, roads, infrastructure, a green field township, an international airport, an international spiritual centre and whatnot, the travel and hospitality sector will flourish in the city. Reports say that there are five branded hotels with a total of 520 rooms in different stages of development in the city as of now.Notably, Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL), Marriott International, Sarovar Hotels & Resorts, and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts have already signed deals to build hotels in Ayodhya. These hotels are expected to be operational by 2024. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has repeatedly ordered officials to focus their efforts on eight key concepts for restoring Ayodhya’s magnificence. Concrete progress is now noticeable as the state government remarkably boosts initiatives to bring Saketpuri, situated on Lord Vishnu’s wheel, to the forefront in the forms of Sanskritik (cultural) Ayodhya, Saksham (capable) Ayodhya, Adhunik (modern) Ayodhya, Sugmay (accessible) Ayodhya, Surmay (beautiful) Ayodhya, Bhawatmak (emotional) Ayodhya, Swacch (clean) Ayodhya, and Ayushman (healthy) Ayodhya.The preparations for the Pran Pratishtha or the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya are going on in full swing. Champat Rai, General Secretary of the Ram Mandir Trust, said that the consecration ceremony will take place on January 21, 22, and 23 of the coming year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will perform the pran-pratishtha for the deity. The event will also witness the presence of prominent saints and other noted figures. According to Champat Rai, the temple trust aims to invite more than 25,000 Hindu religious leaders from 136 Sanatan traditions for the ceremony.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",Smoke canister attack inside Lok Sabha on the anniversary of 2001 Parliament Attack: Who handles the security of Sansad?,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/smoke-canister-attack-inside-lok-sabha-on-anniversary-of-2001-parliament-attack-who-handles-the-security-of-sansad/,"Apart from providing security, Parliament Security Service is also responsible for activities, including guiding visitors through the Parliament House Complex and providing informative sessions on the history of Parliament and its proceedings.The Parliament Security Service manages the security of both houses of the Parliament, Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. It is situated within the Parliament House Complex. It operates under the administrative control of the Joint Secretary (Security) of the Lok Sabha Secretariat and oversees the security operations of both Secretariats.In August 2020, “Unified Operational Command” was established under the Joint Secretary (Security) to enhance the efficiency and coordination among the security personnel. The unified command integrates the security services of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats. Establishing a Unified Operational Command was to ensure uniformity in decision-making processes related to security matters. Notably, the separate Security Services of both houses run simultaneously as their structures are different.Following the tragic terrorist attack on the Parliament House in 2001, the government of India did a comprehensive review of the security arrangements. Subsequent measures were taken to streamline the access points, advanced security gadgets were deployed, and a high-tech access control system was implemented to ensure the safety and security of the MPs and VVIPs. Furthermore, Radio Frequency Tags were introduced to enhance the identification processes and regulate the vehicular movement inside the complex.The Parliament Security Service plays different roles in the complex, including providing security cover to the VVIPs, Members of Parliament, and visitors and conducting anti-sabotage and anti-explosive checks. Other agencies, including Delhi Police, Intelligence Bureau, Parliament Duty Group, Special Protection Group and National Security Guard, coordinate with the Parliament Security Service to ensure smooth operations in the Parliament.Apart from providing security, Parliament Security Service is also responsible for activities, including guiding visitors through the Parliament House Complex and providing informative sessions on the history of Parliament and its proceedings.Parliament Security Service personnel are also deployed for national ceremonies, international conferences, and other events where security is paramount.In a massive security breach in the Parliament, two men jumped into the Lok Sabha well from the visitors’ gallery while the proceedings were going on today, 13 December. After jumping into the well, the two men released some yellow-coloured smoke from canisters. The invasion of the parliament took place on the anniversary of the parliament attack in 2001.Two more people carrying smoke cans were detained outside the parliament. The incident took place at 1 PM during the zero hour in the Lok Sabha, just before the lunch break. When Khagen Murmu, BJP MP from West Bengal, was raising some points regarding his constituency, a commotion was suddenly heard in the background. When the Sansad TV switched to the view of the entire hall, a man could be seen who had already jumped from the gallery and was on the benches. He then started to proceed towards the front of the hall, jumping from bench to bench. People in the Lok Sabah were heard shouting ‘pakdo, pakdo’ (catch him) before the speaker hurriedly adjourned the house. The livestream was cut immediately after that.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"13 December, 2023 ",Watch: Journalists start fighting among themselves to get their hands on the colour canister thrown in parliament,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-start-fighting-for-the-colour-canister-thrown-in-parliament-to-show-on-tv-watch/,"In the viral video, journalist of TV9 Bharatvarsh could be seen showing the remains of the colour bomb on the media screen while other journalists, including a senior editor of CNN News18, Pallavi Ghosh, could be seen snatching the remains to showcase on their respective media screens.The Delhi Police on Wednesday (13th December) detained two persons for protesting with colour smoke bombs outside the Parliament, in front of Transport Bhawan. Two other persons were also detained by the Police who jumped into the Lok Sabha well from the visitors’ gallery while the proceedings were going on and released some yellow-coloured smoke from canisters after jumping into the well. While the incidents highlighted massive security breaches in the Parliament, the media individuals created a separate fuss while reporting about the incident. Several TV journalists gathered in the Parliament premises to report on the detention of the two persons who protested using the colour smoke bombs outside the Parliament. However, they engaged in a brawl as they intended to showcase the evidence, the remains of the colour bombs that the detainees used during the protest. The video of the on-camera fight among the TV journalists is making rounds over social media with netizens questioning the morals and values of the journalists. In the video, journalist of TV9 Bharatvarsh could be seen showing the remains of the colour bomb on the media screen while other journalists including a senior editor of CNN News18, Pallavi Ghosh could be seen snatching the remains to showcase on their respective media screens. “Bahut dikha diye. 5 min ho gaye (you’ve shown this a lot. It’s been 5 mins. Now hand it over),” the other media journalists could be heard saying in the video. The other journalists also displayed media unprofessionalism as they could also be seen blocking the exclusive live video streaming of TV9 Bharatvarsh for exclusively showing the remains of the color bomb. The video since then has been widely shared on social media with netizens calling media individuals ‘shameless’ and ‘clowns’. “Indian Journalists are fighting for the smoke canisters that were used. Shameless!” said one of the netizens while sharing the video clip in which the media journalist could be seen fighting like naive. Indian Journalists are fighting for the smoke canister that were used.Shameless! pic.twitter.com/diXKqepOiZ“Security becomes secondary issue, Indian media is fighting for smoke canisters,” another one said sharing the video. Security gayi tel lene, Indian media is fighting for smoke canisters. 🤡 pic.twitter.com/qQ3YbFTyMBMeanwhile, one of the netizens also attacked the government over media coverage and said that those supporting PM Modi had shown the standard of journalism. “Pallavi ji, don’t do this! Godi Media showing to the world their standard of journalism- fighting over a piece of evidence on Live TV! Is there any depth of shamelessness that Godi media journalists still haven’t explored?” the user said. ‘Pallavi ji, don’t do this!’Godi Media showing to the world their standard of journalism- fighting over a piece of evidence on Live TV!Is there any depth of shamelessness that Godi media journalists still haven't explored? pic.twitter.com/Si619tF7CRThe incident is said to have happened at 1 PM during the zero hour in the Lok Sabha, just before the lunch break. Two persons, a man and a woman used colour bombs to protest outside the Parliament. The duo were detained by the Delhi Police after the former raised the slogans of “Jai Bheem,” “Bharat Mata Ki Jay,” and “Manipur ko insaaf do.” While at present it is not known who is behind this attack, it is notable that Khalistani separatist and Sikhs for Justice leader  Gurpatwant Singh Pannun had recently threatened to attack the Indian parliament on or before 13th December. In a message released last week, he alleged that an attempt by Indian authorities was made to assassinate him, however, the grand scheme fell through. He had warned that by no later than 13 December he would reply by launching an assault on the Indian Parliament and shake its foundation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","As TV reporters shamelessly fight for smoke canister thrown in Parliament, here are a few things we should all be worried about after witnessing...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-fight-colour-canister-parliament-few-things-we-should-be-worried-about/,"If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai who admitted that they were like vultures. On the 13th of December 2023, there was a serious security breach in the Parliament of India. Two individuals hurled a smoke canister from the viewer gallery. They then jumped to the floor of the house and were trying to make their way towards the speaker when were overpowered by parliamentarians. Thereafter they were detained by the police and taken for interrogation. Just as the security breach took place, there were two individuals outside the parliament protesting with similar colour smoke canisters. According to preliminary information from the Delhi Police, there is no terror angle to the incidents, however, the police are taking the breach seriously. According to reports, the intruder inside the parliament was chanting slogans about “Kaala Kanoon” and the protestors outside the Parliament were chanting slogans like Jai Bhim, Tanashahi Nahi Chalegi, Manipur ko Insaf do, etc. While the country was shocked by the serious security breach and the ramifications of the lapse, Indian media was conducting their very own circus. A video emerged where TV journalists were seen fighting like animals over the smoke canister that was hurled by the protestors. In the video put out by TV9, their journalist was showing the smoke canister on camera. While he was doing his segment, other journalists started trying to snatch the canister saying that he had used it enough and should hand over the canister to other journalists. When the other journalists started trying to snatch the canister, the TV9 journalist was seen almost sprinting with it, trying to get a few more seconds with the canister – for the sake of the hard-hitting coverage of the unfolding incident at the Parliament. As the nation had important questions that the media should have been focussing on – like how this security breach took place, who were the intruders, what were they chanting, why they did what they did, what was the police doing and how visitors entered the parliament with canisters and why were the Delhi Police so lackadaisical in arrested the protestors outside the Parliament, almost looking like they were taking them for a walk, these elements in the media seemed far more interested in ridiculous sensationalism and showing visuals of the canister. While we watched this circus unfold, there are several important aspects that people need to be extremely worried about. First and foremost, one has to wonder about the priorities of the media and what they choose to cover when important events unfold. As mentioned, there are very important questions that need to be answered as this security breach unfolds. The Parliament is not just a building but a symbol of the democracy of India and the seat of power. Any attack on the Parliament is an attack on democracy and the sovereignty of India itself. While these events unfolded, the journalists on the ground should have been far more focused on bringing crucial details to the people of the nation. And while several journalists were doing so, some were indulging in cheap sensationalism. This, however, comes as no surprise. One is reminded of the time when Rajdeep Sardesai was talking about the 2001 Parliament Attack – the terrorist attack that incidentally took place on this day 22 years ago. In 2018, a video had gone viral where Rajdeep Sardesai admitted that journalists were vultures. Sardesai in the video recounted the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament where he and his crew were preparing for a picnic owing to a slow news day. Preparing for a feast in the garden near the Parliament, he and his team entered the Parliament at around 11 am. Within minutes of the team entering the Parliament, he says they heard gunshots. The Parliament was attacked. He then recalled that when his colleague asked him to leave, he directed him to suggest the guard to close the gates. He explained with a wide grin that he did so so that no other channel crew could enter. Those days there were fewer channels and Sardesai was excited at the prospect of doing an exclusive story.He then says how the exclusive story of the parliament attack made the team forget the wine and kababs they were planning to picnic on. “It was a great day. We are like vultures. We feed on these moments.” he added.If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran vultures like Rajdeep Sardesai. While the conduct of the media was abysmal, what is far more concerning is the conduct of the Delhi Police and security agencies. When a security breach like this has taken place, one would imagine that the police and law enforcement agencies would ask the media to stand back – after all, 26/11 was a classic case of how the media could potentially jeopardise any rescue operation and investigation when such incidents take place. During the Mumbai Attack, the police allowed unbridled access to the media, resulting in journalists like Barkha Dutt potentially giving away crucial information on hostages from ISI handlers who were closely monitoring the media. Taking a lesson from the past, the police should have summarily kept the media away. That canister itself could be crucial evidence that the police need, instead, the media was yet again given unbridled access to play with the canister as if were some sort of a prop in a drama. On the 22nd anniversary of the ghastly 2001 Parliament attack, the parliament was under severe threat. There were Khalistani and other terror organisations which had issued threats against the Parliament. While now the police are claiming that the smoke was not harmful, while the breach was ongoing, the police had to function under the assumption that it could be a deadly terror attack which could have dire ramifications. Despite that, the media was given unbridled access knowing fully well that such media has a history of creating a circus during serious incidents. Several other questions are being raised against the police as the Parliament’s security was breached. Visitors to the Parliament are frisked at every stage and there are now questions being asked as to how the security could have been so wanting that two individuals with smoke canisters could enter the Parliament. Per protocol, those who have passes to view the Parliament proceedings are not allowed to carry a paper inside the Parliament. Legitimate concerns are now being raised as to how, amid such tight security, two individuals could enter with these canisters. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",Is Farooq Abdullah angry because Kashmir is no longer violent and dangerous? How the calm after the SC verdict has rattled the Gupkar gang,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/farooq-abdullah-hell-remark-kashmir-is-calm-how-sc-verdict-has-rattled-gupkar-gang/,"Earlier, Abdullah had said in a furious tone that Jammu Kashmir could ""go to hell"". When an ANI reporter questioned why he said so, Abdullah said, ""You people are irritating me. No one is doing anything for the 'heaven' and taking it to 'hell'."" On 12th December, National Conference Chief Farooq Abdullah lashed out at the central government following the passage of the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Bill and Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill. He was seemingly irked following the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the abrogation of Article 370. Speaking to ANI, he asserted that tourism in the valley is possible because terrorists do not attack them. He said, “You should be thankful that they are not doing it”, asserting if terrorists start attacking tourists, the tourism in the valley will be finished.Earlier, Abdullah had said in a furious tone that Jammu Kashmir could “go to hell”. When an ANI reporter questioned why he said so, Abdullah said, “You people are irritating me. No one is doing anything for the ‘heaven’ and taking it to ‘hell’.” He cited the famous quote about Kashmir, “If there is heaven on Earth, it is here, it is here, it is this.” and questioned what the government has done for the valley. “You are not conducting any elections happening in all other states. What crime have we committed? Now come to statehood. Tell me one state since independence that was converted to UT from a state. UTs become a state, not the other way around. You have made the state hell.”#WATCH | Delhi | National Conference Chief Farooq Abdullah says, ""…You indeed are taking it to hell. Nothing is being done for 'heaven'…Tell me what is being done for heaven? Elections are taking place everywhere. What is our fault that it is not being held here? Which other… pic.twitter.com/AnTKcmLbNEHe added, “You say that terrorism has ended. Has it ended? Are our soldiers and officers not dying? Are people not dying? You talk about tourism. They [terrorists] have not attacked tourists yet. If they attack only one tourist, tourism will come down to zero. You should be thankful that they are not doing it [attacking tourists]. Our everything depends on it. We do not have any factory. They said they would bring factories. Which factories have been established? Someone from UAE is building a mall here. A mall. We already have a mall. We are citizens of this country. This is our country. But there is no justice for us. What should I do?”Abdullah’s remarks about terrorists not attacking tourists, leading to the possibility of having a tourism industry in the valley, are dangerously bordering on dog whistling. In a way, he hinted at a potential strategy for terrorists to target the flourishing tourism industry in Jammu and Kasmir.Abdullah, who was irked by the Supreme Court’s decision on Article 370 and passage of bills in both houses, tried to oversimplify the complex situation in Kashmir. His statement should be condemned as it can potentially send a wrong message. By insinuating that the absence of terrorist attacks is the reason for flourishing tourism, he failed to acknowledge the collective efforts that the government of India and the UT government made to foster a peaceful environment in the valley.It has to be noted that such statements by prominent leaders like Farooq Abdullah can be interpreted as an inadvertent signal to those who have vested interests in promoting terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. Terrorist groups have a habit of exploiting any perceived weakness or opportunity, which the comments passed by Abdullah provided.Leaders in the valley and the rest of the country need to promote a narrative highlighting Kashmir’s resilience. The people of Kashmir are working towards sustained peace, and statements like those Abdullah made have the potential to nullify such efforts. It is essential to focus on the positive aspects of the region, including rich culture, warm hospitality, and breathtaking landscapes, so that, for the time being, tourism can keep supporting the state’s economy. At the same time, other projects were established in Jammu and Kashmir.In both houses, the opposition asked Home Minister Amit Shah what changed in the valley. In his reply, HM Shah pointed out the number of tourists touched the 2 crore mark in 2023. Furthermore, over 100 films were shot in the valley. There has been no theatre operating in Jammu and Kashmir since 1991. The first theatre opened after a gap of three decades in 2021. Since then, more theatres have opened and over 100 applications are under review from banks to open and operate theatres in the valley.The number of devotees visiting Mata Vaishno Devi Temple and devotees participating in Shri Amarnath Yatra has increased exponentially over the years. HM Shah added that nursing colleges, medical colleges, and other educational institutes have opened in the state after the abrogation of Article 370. Furthermore, the number of medical seats has increased, and a record number of athletes have registered in the state.Speaking about terrorist activities, HM Shah said the total incidents of terrorist activities during UPA time were 7,217. However, since the BJP came to power, the number of such incidents reduced to 2,197. During UPA time, 2,829 security personnel and civilians lost their lives. Compared to that, such deaths were reduced to 891 civilians and security personnel. 2,654 incidents of organised stone pelting happened during UPA.जम्मू-कश्मीर से धारा 370 के हटने के बाद अलगाववाद समाप्त हुआ है और आतंकवाद में बहुत कमी आई है। pic.twitter.com/geK0js2vDlFurthermore, since the Abrogation of Article 370, zero stone-pelting incidents have been reported in the region. 112 civilians died during stone pelting during UPA, but zero such deaths have been reported since the abrogation of Article 370, as no incidents of stone pelting took place. 6,235 civilians were injured in such incidents during UPA, but zero such injuries have been reported since the abrogation of Article 370. In 2010, 70 ceasefire violations were reported, but in 2023, only six such incidents were reported. Similarly, incidents of infiltration attempts clocked to 479 compared to recent reports of 48. In 2010, 18 terrorists reportedly left Kashmir. However, in 2023, 281 terrorists reportedly left Kashmir.HM Shah noted that the central government adopted a Zero Terrorism Plan in Jammu and Kashmir, which has been in action for the last three years. Furthermore, he said that by 2026, he hopes that the plan will achieve its aim to finish terrorism in the valley.अब जम्मू-कश्मीर में आतंकवाद के पूरे इकोसिस्टम को खत्म करने का काम किया जा रहा है। pic.twitter.com/bNgmynNUR6Not to forget, Abdullah is the chairperson of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), also known as the Gupkar Gang. It was formed to restore the erstwhile state’s special status or Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Gupkar Gang was formed in October 2020 when six parties joined to restore Articles 370 and 35A and the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir. The National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peoples Conference (PC), Communist Party of India Marxist (CPI-M), Peoples Movement (PM) and Awami National Conference (ANC) were the first to ally. In November, Congress also joined the gang.Gupkar Gang’s three leaders joined in January 2023 in a nationwide political rally. Farooq’s son and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, and PDP chief and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti joined Congress leader Rahul Gandhi‘s Bharat Jodo Yatra in January last week when the Yatra reached its destination in Kashmir.One year after the abrogation of Article 370, Abdullah claimed that the people of Kashmir “do not feel or want to be Indian”. He added that they would prefer to be ruled by China instead of India. Interestingly, the same Abdullah is now crying that he is an Indian and India is his country. Abdullah stated during a talk show on The Wire’s YouTube channel. He called the abrogation of Article 370 the “last nail in the coffin of India”. The same Abdullah is now claiming tourism is possible in Kashmir because terrorists do not attack tourists. It is interesting to see how the language of these leaders changes with time and how they insert dog whistling while projecting themselves as Kashmir’s messiah.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","Love Jihad in Indore: Ashraf pretends to be Ashu to befriend a Hindu girl, rapes and forces her to convert to Islam",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/love-jihad-indore-hindu-girl-trapped-by-ashraf-raped-forcibly-converted-to-islam/,"A formal complaint has been filed under multiple laws, such as the atrocity act, rape and molestation against the accused at the behest of members of Hindu organisations. An incident of love jihad has come to light in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore where an auto-dealer named Ashraf Mansoori masqueraded as Ashu to trap a 23-year-old Hindu girl into a relationship with him. He then sexually assaulted her while feigning marriage, however, when she asked him to fulfil his promise he forced her to embrace Islam.

"13 December, 2023 ","After facing social media outrage, Urdu portal ‘Rekhta’ takes down book glorifying Islamist Ilmuddin, who killed Mahashay Rajpal in 1929 over ‘blasphemy’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/rekhta-portal-removes-book-glorifying-islamist-killer-after-outrage/,"The Urdu literary web portal Rekhta operated by Sanjiv Saraf’s non-profit organisation Rekhta Foundation was promoting the biography of an Islamist killer who had killed a Hindu man for alleged ‘blasphemy’ against the Prophet Muhammad. On Monday (11th December), the Urdu portal ‘Rekhta’ took down the book glorifying Islamist Ilmuddin, who killed Mahashay Rajpal in 1929 over ‘blasphemy’. Rekhta removed the book after facing social media outrage. Rekhta portal had displayed a book in its e-books list titled ‘Sawaneh Umri Ghazi Ilmuddin Shaheed’, which means ‘a biography of martyr Ilmuddin’. This book is written by Mohammad Afzal Hashmi. The 102-page Urdu book was originally published in 1930 by Munshi Azizuddin Tajiran-E-Kutub, Lahore. The Urdu literary web portal Rekhta operated by Sanjiv Saraf’s non-profit organisation Rekhta Foundation was promoting the biography of an Islamist killer who had killed a Hindu man for alleged ‘blasphemy’ against the Prophet Muhammad. Now, this book has been removed from the website after an outrage on social media.After this tweet by @theskindoctor13 , social media outrage and calling out extremist material, Rekhta has taken down the book on Ilmuddin. https://t.co/Zy0iPS3Y6SThe current edition of this book with Rekhta was made available by Jamia Hamdard in Delhi. The information surfaced as the annual three-day festival of the Urdu-promoting organisation – Jashn-E-Rekhta – was organised from 8th December to 10th December at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi. Besides Mushaira and other talks in the Jashn-E-Rekhta program, the Rekhta Foundation also has various counters for selling books and other merchandise where many Urdu books were for sale. Rekhta also keeps many old books in digital format on its website. This biography of Islamist Ilmuddin was one such book. It was contributed by Jamia Hamdard. It means that the Delhi-based university had provided the hard copy of the old publication using which the e-book was made. Rekhta has now removed the extremist material from its website.Ilmuddin killed author and publisher Mahashay Rajpal on 6th April 1929 in Lahore. Ilmuddin – a carpenter – was 19 years old at that time. stabbed Mahashay Rajpal in his chest eight times while he was seated on the outer verandah of his shop. Mahashay Rajpal did not survive the attack. The reason for this murder was alleged blasphemy. It was no different than what we see as death threats and beheading threats like ‘Sar Tan Se Juda’ for alleged blasphemy or alleged insult of the Islamic prophet in contemporary times.Mahashay Rajpal published a book named Rangeela Rasool. He was killed for publishing this so-called satire on Prophet Muhammad. Mahashay Rajpal’s book came in response to two provoking books by Muslims. In fact, in 1923, Muslims published two books. One was named ‘Krishna, your Gita will have to be burnt’. In this, Muslims made indecent and obscene comments about Lord Krishna. The other book was ‘The Maharshi of the Nineteenth Century’. The book contained derogatory remarks on Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj.In 1924, the British banned the book. Several cases were registered against the book under Section 153 A of the IPC. In 1927, Mahashay Rajpal was let off by evidence that what was written in the book was based on facts, so it cannot be said that it increased hatred between the two groups.When the court pronounced the verdict regarding this book, the Muslims were even more enraged and shaken. They started rioting and there was a demand to behead Mahashay Rajpal. The slogans described how the killing of Mahashay Rajpal is allowed in Islamic Sharia. After receiving death threats for years and surviving two attacks, Mahashay Rajpal was killed by Ilmuddin in 1929.Rekhta portal and its annual event named the Jashn-E-Rekhta have a legacy of controversies on issues against Hindu interests. In February 2017, progressive Muslim commentator, renowned columnist and famous television personality late Tarek Fatah was abused and heckled at the Urdu poetry festival Jashn-E-Rekhta held at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi National Centre of Arts. Fatah, who attended the festival as an audience member, was hit with sticks on his back and feet. Slogans like “Modi ka kutta, Tarek Fatah” and “Death to Tarek Fatah” were raised by the protesters.In 2020, Rekhta also tried to paint the Hindu festival of Diwali in an Islamic colour by calling it a kind of Eid. Rekhta tried to give an Urdu dictionary to Diwali and some popular words related to it through a poster and on this pretext it adopted an Islamic religious agenda.The words Rekhta gave in this poster were Diwali, gifts, celebrations, holidays, etc. The list of words associated with Diwali also included ‘air pollution’. Cleverly, Rekhta launched this poster in the market during Diwali days and along with describing Diwali as Eid, ‘air pollution’ was also added to the word associated with it. Rekhta’s intention was not to wish a happy Diwali. Instead, it was a blatant attempt at the Islamization of the Hindu festival.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",Terror conspiracy case: NIA raids half a dozen locations in Bengaluru days after massive crackdown on ISIS terrorists,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/terror-conspiracy-case-nia-raids-half-a-dozen-locations-in-bengaluru-massive-crackdown-on-isis/,"The move comes days after the NIA, in a massive crackdown on ISIS, arrested 15 operatives of the banned terror outfit on December 9 during multiple and widespread raids across Maharashtra and Karnataka.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday conducted searches in over half a dozen locations in Bengaluru in a terror conspiracy case.Multiple NIA teams raided various locations in Bengaluru in close coordination with the state police force based on specific inputs.The raids are still underway at the premises of suspects who have terror links and are operating at the direction of their foreign handlers. Besides, the suspects had been actively involved in various terrorist activities.The move comes days after the NIA, in a massive crackdown on ISIS, arrested 15 operatives of the banned terror outfit on December 9 during multiple and widespread raids across Maharashtra and Karnataka.In the case, the NIA teams swooped down on as many as 44 locations in Padgha-Borivali, Thane, Mira Road, Pune in Maharashtra, and Bengaluru in Karnataka and apprehended the 15 accused for promoting terror and terror-related acts and activities of the proscribed organisation.Huge amounts of unaccounted cash, firearms, sharp-edged weapons, incriminating documents, smartphones and other digital devices were seized during the raids, conducted as part of the NIA’s ongoing efforts to disrupt and demolish the attempts of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to carry out violent acts of terror and take innocent lives.NIA investigations have further revealed in the case that the accused, all members of the ISIS Maharashtra module, were operating from Padgha-Borivali, where they had hatched the conspiracy to spread terror and carry out acts of violence across India. Pursuing the path of violent Jihad, Khilafat, and ISIS the accused had aimed to disturb the peace and communal harmony of the country and to wage a war against the government of India.Initial investigations have revealed that the arrested accused had self-declared the village of Padgha in rural Thane as a ‘liberated zone’ and as ‘Al-Sham’. They were motivating impressionable Muslim youth to relocate to Padgha from their place of residence to strengthen the Padgha base.Saqib Nachan, the main accused and the leader and head of the ISIS module was also administering the ‘bayath’ (oath of allegiance to the Khalifa of ISIS ) to the persons joining the proscribed organisation.ISIS is a Global Terror Organisation (GTG), also known as Islamic State (IS), Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL), Daish, Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), ISIS Wilayat Khorasan, Islamic State of Iraq and Sham Khorasan (ISIS-K). The outfit has been spreading its terror network in India by putting in place localised ISIS modules and cells in various states of the country.NIA has, in recent months, also conducted large-scale raids and busted different ISIS modules by arresting several terror operatives in the ISIS terror conspiracy case in a bid to scuttle the organisation’s heinous and violent anti-India agenda.As part of its efforts towards that end, the agency registered a case against the ISIS Maharashtra module earlier this year and has, since then, undertaken strong and concerted actions to destroy the various ISIS modules and networks operating across the country.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"13 December, 2023 ","US seeks extradition of Nikhil Gupta, in custody in Czech Republic, for the alleged plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/gurpatwant-pannun-murder-plot-us-wants-to-extradite-nikhil-gupta-from-czech-republic/,"Nikhil Gupta was arrested in Czech Republic in June 2023 as per request of the USA, and is being kept in custody while US requests his extradition The arrest and temporary detention of the 52-year-old Nikhil Gupta who was allegedly involved in the conspiracy to assassinate pro-Khalistan radical Gurpatwant Singh Pannun have been verified by the Czech Ministry of Justice, reported India Today. The United States which has accused the Indian national of being involved in a “murder for hire” operation aimed at the chief of the banned Sikhs For Justice outfit demanded to initiate the action. According to US investigators, the accused planned to kill the Khalistani terrorist in their country with the help of an unidentified Indian government employee. He was taken into custody in the Czech Republic by the country’s law enforcement officials in June 2023. A representative for the Czech Ministry of Justice Vladimir Repka revealed that Nikhil Gupta was captured at the US government’s request after which it made an extradition request. The US authorities have detailed the charges against him including conspiracy to “murder for hire.” They submitted the extradition request in August 2023 citing the aforementioned accusation. The Prague Municipal Public Prosecution Office moved to deem Nikhil Gupta’s extradition admissible after conducting preliminary inquiries. The ruling, however, is not yet legally enforceable. He was indicted by the US Justice Department on 20th November for his suspected role in the murder plot.“An Indian government employee, working together with others, including Gupta, in India and elsewhere, directed a plot to assassinate on US soil an attorney and political activist who is a US citizen of Indian origin residing in New York City,” claimed a statement released by the US officials. He had allegedly given an assassin $100,000 to carry out the murder with a $15,000 down payment already received on 9 June of this year. However, the person he reached out to recruit the hitman was a confidential informant for US law enforcement.Nikhil Gupta is being prosecuted with murder for hire, a crime which carries a potential 10-year sentence. According to the Justice Department, an Indian government employee known as CC-1 was in charge of the murder plot from India. Nikhil Gupta is also believed to be involved in the global trafficking of drugs and firearms. Furthermore, he allegedly attempted to hire a hitman who was an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent.New Delhi responded to the accusation and asserted that it was against government policy and was concerned that one of its officials was associated with the conspiracy. Afterwards, the Indian government formed a high-level inquiry committee to probe into “all the relevant aspects of the matter.”Notably, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun has repeatedly threatened India with terrorist actions including blowing up an Air India flight as well as attacking the Indian parliament as a retaliation for the alleged plan of the Indian government to eliminate him. He described himself as a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, however, no action has been taken against him by either nation despite his regular terror threats and assaults on Indians including diplomats living on their soil by his followers and supporters.

There is no need to search, the truth is in front of everyone. Everyone should accept that truth. Muslims and people belonging to other religions should come forward and hand over the disputed religious places of Hindus to the Hindu community,"" he said. On Tuesday (12th December), Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Indresh Kumar advised the Muslim community to hand over all the disputed religious sites to the Hindu community. “Muslims and people belonging to other religions should voluntarily hand over all disputed religious sites to the Hindu community,” he said in an interview with PTI. He stated that Mohan Bhagwat, the chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), made it quite apparent when he said that there was no need to find Shivling in every mosque. “Bhagwat’s statement was aimed at putting an end to mutual conflict so that society can think and reflect while being free from hatred and violence,” he said. According to Indresh Kumar who is the national executive member of the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, foreign invaders destroyed temples that belonged to Sanatanis. “What Mohan Bhagwat said is very clear. There is no need to search, the truth is in front of everyone. Everyone should accept that truth. Muslims and people belonging to other religions should come forward and hand over the disputed religious places of Hindus to the Hindu community,” he said. Kumar further expressed joy over the completion of the Ram Temple and said that the building of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya has created a happy atmosphere not just in the nation but also abroad. “Ram temple is for everyone…Ram temple (Ayodhya) is a national temple. Ram is for all and everyone. India is a nation that accepts and respects all religions. Therefore, it is right to call it Ram Temple a national temple,” he said.It is pertinent to know that there are many religious places in the country on which disputes between Hindus and Muslims are going on. There was dispute over the Ram Temple in Ayodhya for many years. The disputed site of Babri Masjid was demolished and later the Supreme Court also issued permission to construct Ram temple on the birth place of Lord Rama. Similarly, there is still debate ongoing about Varanasi’s disputed Gyanvapi Mosque structure. The issue surrounding Mathura’s disputed Shahi Eidgah also remains unsettled.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He is reportedly the mastermind behind the illegal betting nexus. It is believed that he may get arrested soon and handed over to the Indian authorities. In October, Red Corner notices were issued against Chandrakar and Uppal after ED filed a case in a Special Court in Raipur and obtained a non-bailable warrant against both.On 12th December (local time), Dubai Police arrested Ravi Uppal, one of the two prime accused in the Mahadev App case. Dubai Police may soon extradite him to India, where the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is investigating the case. Uppal is facing money laundering charges where kickbacks were allegedly paid to Congress leader and former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel.The Mahadev App Money Laundering case involves transactions worth Rs 6,000 crore.The arrest was made in response to the Red Corner notice issued on request of ED. The Indian officials have been informed about the arrest. The Dubai Police has reportedly expressed willingness to deport Uppal to India.Another accused in the matter, Sourabh Chandrakar, is also in the UAE. He is reportedly the mastermind behind the illegal betting nexus. It is believed that he may get arrested soon and handed over to the Indian authorities. In October, Red Corner notices were issued against Chandrakar and Uppal after ED filed a case in a Special Court in Raipur and obtained a non-bailable warrant against both.ED filed a charge sheet in the matter and got an open-ended non-bailable warrant against the accused. These two were required for the application of the Red Corner notice. Once ED fulfilled the criteria, the message was issued to seek extradition of the accused from the foreign jurisdiction.Earlier, one of the promoters of the app, Shubham Soni, released a video and alleged to have paid Rs 500 crore as kickbacks to Congress politicians. The matter was raised extensively by the Bharatiya Janata Party during the Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a statement, “Mahadev Ko Bhi Nahi Chhoda” (They did not spare Bhagwan Mahadev) during the campaign. It is believed that the Mahadev App Scam played a vital role in Congress’s defeat in the state.On 3rd November, ED issued a press note that said that one of the couriers of Mahadev App, Asim Das, was arrested on 2nd November with Rs 5 crore cash. During questioning and from the forensic examination of the phone recovered from Das, the agency came to know that regular payments were made to former CM Baghel. So far, Rs 508 crore has been paid to Congress leaders. Das allegedly confessed that the cash found on him was meant for politician “Baghel”, and he was delivering the money on behalf of Uppar and Chandrakar. However, later, he withdrew his allegations.The Mahadev app is an illicit online betting platform that laundered the money it collected from players who aren’t in India. Four individuals, including primary accused Saurabh Chandrakar and Madhya Pradesh’s Ravi Uppal, developed the Mahadev betting software which progressively supplanted at least ten other similar illegal betting apps that were in widespread usage across the nation. The matter involves transactions worth Rs 6,000 crore. A few of the apps that were formerly a part of the Mahadev betting fold are Lotus 365 and ReddyAnna. India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Pakistan are all connected to Mahadev Online Book (MOB) through its headquarters in the United Arab Emirates.

Another image has been pointed out by social media users showing a prop like a piece of rubble which they allege resembles the Palestinian map.Several pro-Palestinian users on X, including Islamists like Majid Freeman, have likened these Zara campaign images to the scenes emerging out of Gaza amid Israeli strikes on Hamas.Islamists compared the Zara images with the bodies of the deceased wrapped in white in Gaza, with mothers holding their children wrapped in a white cloth, and damaged buildings.Deleting the campaign from the website and across social media, the Spanish clothing brand has now issued a statement.“After listening to comments regarding the latest Zara Atelier campaign “The Jacket”, we would like to share the following with out customers.”The company said that the campaign “presents a series of images of unfinished sculptures in a sculptor’s studio and was created with the sole purpose of showcasing craftmade garments in an artistic context”.Zara stated that some customers were offended and saw in those images something far from what was intended when they were created.“Unfortunately, some customers felt offended by these images, which have not been removed, and saw in them something far from what was intended when they were created,” it stated.It concluded by saying that it regrets the misunderstanding. “We reaffirm our deep respect towards everyone,” the brand stated.On 10th December, a page called Palestine Online shared a video of a Palestinian alleging that Zara is making fun of their people and fun of their children being killed.A video of another user is going viral where she can be heard calling for boycott of the fashion brand.Radical, terrorism supporting Islamists like Majid Freeman have also waded in to capitalise on the boycott trend calling the Zara collection as the “Gaza genocide collection”.Amidst the boycott, an old controversy linked to Zara’s Israeli head designer resurfaced. In June 2021, the brand’s head women’s designer Vanessa Perilman in a private chat with a pro-Palestinian model lashed out at Hamas.The screenshot of her message, which was made viral by the pro-Palestine model Qaher Harhash, read, “Maybe if your people were educated then they wouldn’t blow up the hospitals and schools that Israel helped to pay for in Gaza.”Her message further read, “Israelis don’t teach children to hate or throw stones at soldiers as your people do.”In a stark reality check to the model, she wrote, “I think it’s funny that you are a model because, in reality, that is against what the Muslim faith believes in and if you were to come out of the closet in any Muslim country, you would be stoned to death.”The model continued to share more screenshots of Perilman’s messages even as she received death threats against her children.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ",66% decline in killing of security personnel in J&K during encounters with terrorists between 2018 and 2022: MHA talks numbers in LS,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/massive-decline-killing-security-personnel-jammu-and-kashmir-2018-2022-mha-numbers/,"Rai shared data that shows that the number of security personnel of the Army, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Jammu and Kashmir Police, including Special Police Officers (SPOs), who were killed in encounters during 2018 was 44 in 2018, followed by 27 in 2019, 33 in 2020, 16 in 2021 and 14 in 2022. There has been a significant 66 per cent decline in the killing of security personnel in Jammu and Kashmir during encounters with terrorists that took place between 2018 and 2022,” the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. Union Minister of State for Home Nityanad Rai shared the input in a written reply to Lok Sabha MP Kamlesh Paswan when he asked about “the number of soldiers martyred in encounters with terrorists in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir during the last five years, including police, Central Armed Police Forces and Army personnel.”. Rai shared data that shows that the number of security personnel of the Army, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Jammu and Kashmir Police, including Special Police Officers (SPOs), who were killed in encounters during 2018 was 44 in 2018, followed by 27 in 2019, 33 in 2020, 16 in 2021 and 14 in 2022. As per the data, a total of 134 security forces were killed in different encounters between 2018 and 2022 in Jammu and Kashmir and the number has continued declining trend since 2018. The reason behind the declining trend in the killing of security personnel in Jammu and Kashmir, the MoS said, is due to the government’s policy of zero tolerance against terrorism. “The approach of the government is to dismantle the terror eco-system. Security measures are being strengthened to sustain peace and stability in Jammu and Kashmir,” Rai said. “The strategies adopted and actions taken for making Jammu and Kashmir free from terrorist activities include round-the-clock nakas at strategic points, group security in the form of static guards, intensified Cordon and Search Operations (CASO) to effectively deal with the challenges posed by terrorist organizations, sharing of intelligence inputs on a real-time basis, amongst all security forces, operating in Jammu and Kashmir.” Day and night area domination, security arrangements through appropriate deployment, preventive operations involve identifying the strategic supporters of terrorism and initiating investigations to expose their mechanism of aiding and abetting terrorism, identification of vulnerable spots to prevent terrorist attacks on civilians are taking other steps, Rai said. Besides, the MOS said, sensitising men on the ground about the issue and initiating measures to defeat the machinations of terrorists or their mentors are the steps taken so far.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

Sheer negligence from the administration is the… pic.twitter.com/ncwdSh9bykEarlier in the day (on 12th December), OpIndia reported that for several days Ayyappa devotees and opposition parties have been accusing the Kerala governments of sabotaging the Sabarimala pilgrimage. Several opposition leaders have lambasted the state government and temple management authorities for gross mismanagement and for allegedly diverting more security personnel for Kerala CM Pinnarayi Vijayan’s statewide trip. It is alleged that the authorities didn’t provide adequate police security for management and crowd control at the Sabarimala pilgrimage and didn’t make arrangements for basic amenities for Sabarimala devotees. State BJP president K. Surendran accused the LDF government of sabotaging the Sabarimala pilgrimage. He stated that the Vijayan government has ignored the Sabarimala pilgrimage for its own vested interests as the pilgrims are having a very tough time with facilities appallingly poor.In the wake of this mismanagement, the devotees have been waiting for more than 20 hours in long queues. Usually we hear Swamy Saranam Ayyappa Nama japam in the queue lines but due to heavy rush and poor management pilgrims were chanting down down police and CM.Yesterday was worst day in life. Never travel with kids. Too much suffocation in Q lanes#Sabarimala pic.twitter.com/1CMFk0NwVDIn many cases, the police and temple management authorities have manhandled devotees for highlighting these issues. Reportedly, the devotees are facing an acute shortage of basic amenities like clean water and food, and one 11-year-old girl child died.  A similar case was witnessed in Trichy’s Srirangam Temple premises in which Ayyappa devotees were allegedly manhandled and assaulted by temple management staff and police personnel deployed on the pilgrimage route. A video footage of the incident in which an Ayyappa devotee was seen bleeding went viral on social media. Sharing the video of an injured Ayyappa devotee, BJP state president K Annamalai condemned the incident. He also launched a scathing attack on temple management authorities including Tamil Nadu’s Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Department (HR & CE). Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ",‘Must proceed with extreme caution’: PM Modi on the use of AI,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/must-proceed-with-extreme-caution-pm-modi-on-the-use-of-ai/,"""AI is having a significant impact on both present and future generations. We must proceed with extreme caution. I believe that the suggestions and ideas emerging from this summit will help us safeguard the world from the potential risks and challenges posed by the darker aspects of AI,"" PM Modi said. Highlighting that artificial intelligence (AI) has a significant impact on both present and future generations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that one must proceed with extreme caution to safeguard all sections of society.“AI is having a significant impact on both present and future generations. We must proceed with extreme caution. I believe that the suggestions and ideas emerging from this summit will help us safeguard the world from the potential risks and challenges posed by the darker aspects of AI,” PM Modi said while addressing the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence Summit (GPAI) 2023, being held here at Bharat Manadapam in Delhi.The Prime Minister said that India is a front-runner in the field of AI and its subsets and added that the nation is striving to bring about a social transformation through AI.Noting further, PM Modi said, “Recently, we launched an AI check portal in Agriculture, which facilitates farmers in checking their application status, accessing payment details, and staying informed about government schemes with ease.”Notably, India wants to use AI to address societal needs in areas such as healthcare, education, agriculture, smart cities, infrastructure, smart mobility, and transportation. AI Mission is also set to be launched here in India to bring computing power into the hands of startups and innovators in the country so that they can tackle problems in the above-mentioned areas.“We are set to launch the AI Mission in Bharat, focusing on promoting the use of AI in sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, and education. Our national AI portal will play a crucial role in supporting and promoting these AI initiatives,” PM Modi said.The challenges surrounding AI in India revolve around issues such as low adoption in corporate processes, limited data ecosystems, low research intensity, an unfavourable intellectual property regime, skill development gaps, and unclear regulations for security, privacy, and ethics.“The more inclusive the development journey of AI is, the better results society will achieve. Learning from past decades where there was inequality in access to technology, we must now safeguard society from such harm. When democratic values join technology, it acts as a multiplier for inclusivity,” he noted.Prime Minister Modi also raised concerns over deep fakes and other cons of artificial intelligence at the newly built Bharat Mandapam.While speaking at the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence Summit (GPAI) 2023, being held here in the national capital, PM Modi said that the deep fake challenge is for the entire world as it could be used to create ‘deepfakes’ to purposefully spread false information or have malicious intent behind their use.If AI enables arms to reach the hands of terror groups, then it could have a devastating effect, and the world needs to think about it, the Prime Minister said.“AI has several positive impacts, but it has many negative impacts too, which is a matter of concern. AI can become the biggest tool in the development of the 21st century. But it can also play the biggest role in destroying the 21st century… Deepfake is a challenge for the whole world… AI tools going into the hands of terrorists are also a big threat. If terrorist organisations get AI weapons, this will have a huge impact on global security… We need to plan how to tackle this,” PM Modi said during his address.The GPAI Summit 2023 is poised to be a milestone event, offering a unique opportunity for stakeholders to contribute to shaping the future of AI.The summit, running from December 12 to 14, gathers influential minds from various sectors, marking a crucial moment for the collaborative advancement of artificial intelligence (AI).As the host city, New Delhi is buzzing with anticipation, gearing up to welcome key stakeholders, experts, and enthusiasts in the field of AI. The inaugural event will set the tone for three days of insightful discussions, deliberations, and collaborations.Since its inception in June 2020, India has made significant contributions to this summit by actively engaging in various initiatives to foster the development, deployment, and adoption of open, safe, secure, and accountable AI.

"12 December, 2023 ","‘Tu Kaun, Main Khaamkha’: Pakistan rejects Supreme Court of India’s verdict on abrogation of Article 370",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/tu-kaun-main-khaamkha-pakistan-rejects-supreme-court-of-india-verdict-on-abrogation-of-article-370/,"Pakistan asserted that Jammu and Kashmir is an internationally-recognised dispute. However, these assertions are not only outdated but also baseless. It is high time Pakistan acknowledge the ground reality – Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, including Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK), are integral parts of India.On 11th December, Pakistan’s Foreign Affairs office issued a press note rejecting the judgment announced by the Supreme Court of India on the status of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. In the press note, Pakistan asserted the region is disputed and continued referring to its unfounded claim.Pakistan asserted that Jammu and Kashmir is an internationally-recognised dispute. However, these assertions are not only outdated but also baseless. Notably, the international community has witnessed the evolving dynamics of the region. It is high time Pakistan acknowledge the ground reality – Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, including Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK), are integral parts of India.🔊: PR NO. 2️⃣2️⃣5️⃣/2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣3️⃣Pakistan Rejects the Indian Supreme Court’s Verdict on Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir🔗⬇️ https://t.co/bsemHte2nF pic.twitter.com/DsFH9AovuEPakistan claimed that the aspirations should make the final disposition of Jammu and Kashmir of the people of Kashmir. That assertion is misleading as the hostile neighbour conveniently overlooked the fact that the majority of the Kashmiris chose to be part of India, and they regularly participate in the democratic processes. The separatism that is rooted in the region is not because of the people of Kashmir but because of the propaganda being spread by Pakistan since its formation out of India in 1947.Pakistan insisted on UN resolutions, which are another smokescreen to divert attention from its failed status to respect the rights of the people it claims to “champion”. Not to forget, Pakistan consistently promotes insurgency and terrorism in the region, making it difficult for the people of Kashmir to live peaceful and progressive lives. It was only after the abrogation of Article 370 in the region that Jammu and Kashmir saw a notable dip in incidents of terrorist attacks, deaths of civilians and, armed forces and stone pelting.On 11th December, Home Minister Amit Shah informed Rajya Sabha how the situation has improved in the region in terms of terrorist activities and stone pelting, etc. He said that total incidents of terrorist activities during UPA time were 7,217. However, since the BJP came to power, the number of such incidents reduced to 2,197. During UPA time, 2,829 security personnel and civilians lost their lives. Compared to that, such deaths were reduced to 891 civilians and security personnel died. 2,654 incidents of organised stone pelting happened during UPA.Furthermore, since the Abrogation of Article 370, zero stone-pelting incidents have been reported in the region. 112 civilians died during stone pelting during UPA, but zero such deaths have been reported since the abrogation of Article 370, as no incidents of stone pelting took place. 6,235 civilians were injured in such incidents during UPA, but zero such injuries have been reported since the abrogation of Article 370. In 2010, 70 ceasefire violations were reported, but in 2023, only six such incidents were reported. Similarly, incidents of infiltration attempts clocked to 479 compared to recent reports of 48. In 2010, 18 terrorists reportedly left Kashmir. However, in 2023, 281 terrorists reportedly left Kashmir.Pakistan has consistently refused to acknowledge that the Constitution of India has supremacy over Jammu and Kashmir. It shows the hostile neighbour’s deliberate attempt to undermine India’s legal and constitutional processes. By indulging in such actions, Pakistan is not only defying established norms in the region but also promoting a dangerous narrative that threatens the sovereignty of India.In the press note, Pakistan criticised the apex court’s verdict on the status of Jammu and Kashmir. It termed the judgment as a travesty of justice, which was in itself based on distorted historical and legal arguments. It is essential to remind Pakistan that the judgment passed by the Supreme Court of India’s five-judge bench, including the Chief Justice of India, perfectly aligns with the ground reality. Furthermore, the foundation of the verdict was based on the will of the region’s people.Pakistan asserted that the restoration of statehood and conduct of elections in Jammu and Kashmir could not serve as a substitute for the right to self-determination. Pakistan’s flawed assertion missed the aims of the Indian government’s initiatives that are bringing normalcy and development to the region. The government of India is addressing the local population’s concerns and bringing Jammu and Kashmir’s people to the mainstream.Pakistan mentioned human rights violations in its press notes. The funny thing is that Pakistan’s track record of human rights violations is internationally talked about. The minorities in Pakistan face serious challenges, including abductions, forced conversions and murders. Pakistan has actively supported terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. The irony is the hostile neighbour itself is facing a rise in terror attacks.It is high time for Pakistan to recognise the hollowness of its outdated claims over the region. Pakistan must acknowledge the legitimate aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to stay with India. As the Indian government has repeatedly said, Pakistan must hand over the occupied regions of Kashmir immediately and vacate them so that the people of Kashmir can breathe in peace.The Supreme Court on 11th December upheld the abrogation of Article 370, which grants a special and separate Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 and Article 35A of the Indian Constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir thereby giving it a separate identity from the rest of India. Key takeaways of the judgment can be seen here. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

It was founded by IPS Vikas Vaibhav. The goal of the people associated with this NGO is to build a developed and better Bihar state. More than fifty thousand people gathered in Begusarai at the call of Inspector General of Police Vikas Vaibhav. The event ‘Namaste Bihar’ organized by IPS Vaibhav is being massively talked about as he started a campaign in Bihar to raise social consciousness, and hundreds of programs have been planned under the said campaign. During the “Namaste Bihar” program held at GD College in Begusarai, IPS officer Vikas Vaibhav stated that a man becomes great when his thinking is big. In Bihar, there are about 9 crore youths under 30 years of age. Bihar must become a developed state if India is to become a developed nation, he said. IPS officer Vikas Vaibhav has established a ‘Let’s Inspire Bihar’ NGO to continue the social campaign and lead the development of the state of Bihar. Speaking at the ‘Namaste Bihar’ program, he said that there are those who wish for caste strife to persist forever. This needs to end for us. He said that if people want to work for the government, they should go ahead and do so, but should not practice corruption within the system. “It is crucial that we carry out our duties honestly in order to achieve our collective goal of development. More than 50 thousand people are being claimed to have participated in this program.#नमस्ते_बिहार प्रथम बृहत जन संवाद को सफल बनाने हेतु सभी के प्रति हृदय से आभार व्यक्त करता हूँ। यह कोई राजनैतिक/धार्मिक कार्यक्रम नहीं था परंतु बिहार के सभी 38 जिलों से 50,000+ की संख्या में #राष्ट्रकवि_दिनकर की भूमि में जुटे हर जाति-संप्रदाय के व्यक्ति का संकल्प मात्र #बिहार था । pic.twitter.com/oCjfC4A5y4IPS Vikas Vaibhav said that if Bihar has to be made a developed state, then people there will first have to improve the business and industry sectors. People should participate in profit-making and contribute to the state economy, he said. People associated with Bihar from all over the country participated in the said event which is widely being discussed on social media.Senior journalist Vikas Bhadauria wrote on Twitter, “IPS Vikas Vaibhav has started a campaign named Let’s Inspire Bihar, a big rally of this campaign was held in Begusarai. This crowd attracted attention though it was not a political or religious program, thousands of members associated with this campaign have so far done many programs in the country and abroad. “Today, when these people gathered, there was a demand that people should be freed from caste-sect, sectarianism, rise up, and together build the brightest and golden future of Bihar. Moreover, the target has also been set to restore Bihar’s development by the year 2047, where there would be no migration, no lack of education or employment, however, such movements are the lifeblood of a dynamic Indian and it is important that they continue to be spread,” Bhadauria tweeted.आईपीएस विकास वैभव ने Let's Inspire Bihar नाम का अभियान शुरू किया है, इस अभियान की एक बड़ी रैली बेगूसराय में हुई, इस भीड़ ने इसलिए ध्यान खींचा क्यों कि ये राजनीतिक या धार्मिक कार्यक्रम नहीं था, इस अभियान से जुड़े हज़ारों सदस्य अब तक देश-विदेशों में कई कार्यक्रमों कर चुके हैं, आज… pic.twitter.com/sr184PpVtCThe unique aspect of this event is that this massive assembly of thousands of people was organized without the support of any political power. Nor was there going to be any benefit to the people, yet such a huge gathering took place only with the intention to restore and bring back the development of Bihar. The attendees even pledged saying, “I will transform Bihar and honor the land of my ancestors. We’re embracing resolutions.” मैं बदलूंगा बिहार ! मैं करूंगा अपने पूर्वजों की भूमि का पुनरुद्धार ! #नमस्ते_बिहार 🙏 pic.twitter.com/cbQfHOJ2wQ‘Let’s Inspire Bihar’ is an NGO, which runs social awareness and public awareness campaigns. It was founded by IPS Vikas Vaibhav. The goal of the people associated with this NGO is to build a developed and better Bihar state. Through this NGO, Biharis living outside Bihar are also connected and are ready to provide all kinds of support. According to IPS Vikas Vaibhav, social rather than political change is necessary for Bihar’s redevelopment. He is campaigning nonstop to bring about this transformation.Vikas Vaibhav, posted in Bihar as an IPS officer, has never said publicly about his involvement in politics, but he always says that the right people have to come into politics. If honest people come into politics, change in society will also arrive rapidly.According to IPS Vikas Vaibhav, decent, altruistic, and truthful people ought to enter politics. In the meantime, speculation about his desire to go into politics has begun. However, Vikas Vaibhav stated in a media interview that he is currently occupied with rebuilding Bihar through his NGO. “I am busy making people aware. Instead of being with my family every Saturday and Sunday, I try to be with the entire Bihar, so that I can bring social change in Bihar,” he said. He added that he will not stop here, but a similar big program will be organized in Arrah on 20th December.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ",First-time MLA and four-time state General Secretary Bhajan Lal Sharma: BJP signals organisational importance in choosing new CM for Rajasthan,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-rajasthan-general-secretary-bhajan-lal-sharma-cm/,"He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), contrary to the media speculations, announced Bhajan Lal Sharma as the CM-designate of Rajasthan. Further, his appointment is seen as a major deviation from the general political trend. Usually, seniority and political growth had been adjudged by the number of times a leader has been elected to the state assembly or Lok Sabha. 56-year-old Bhajan Lal Sharma is a first-time MLA. He completed his MA (politics) from Rajasthan University, Jaipur, in 1993.He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The BJP had fielded him after denying a ticket to the sitting MLA Ashok Lahoti. However, Sharma, a resident of Bharatpur, is said to have a strong hold on organisational politics. Before plunging into electoral politics, he had been working in the organisation for a long time. Bhajan Lal Sharma has been playing an important part in BJP’s organisational structure in Rajasthan. He has served as the state general secretary for the Bharatiya Janata Party four times. Previously, he had been associated with RSS and ABVP. For this reason, he is considered close to the party’s ideological mentor RSS, and party chief JP Nadda.The three major announcements on three consecutive days have signalled that the organisational importance played a major role in these major selections. A key similarity in these decisions has been the history of these leaders in serving various organisational roles and strengthening the party’s cadre in these states. Apart from Sharma, Dr. Mohan Yadav, the new CM-designate of Madhya Pradesh had held several organisational posts in BJP and its ideological mentor RSS. Yadav, who started student politics at Madhav Science College, and held many positions in the party. In 1982, he was the co-secretary of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union and in 1984, he was the President of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union.Mohan Yadav assumed the responsibility of Municipal Minister of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Ujjain) in the year 1984 and Department Head in 1986. In the year 1988, Yadav was the state co-secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Madhya Pradesh) and a member of the national executive. He was the State Minister of the State Unit of the Council in 1989-90 and the National Minister of the Council in the year 1991-92. In 1993-95, he served as the functionary (Sangh Karyavah) of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Ujjain Nagar. Additionally, his appointment was also seen as a major signal of political empowerment for the Yadav community, a dominant political force in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, however, have lacked proper proportional representation owing to the family-oriented politics of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD). Similarly, Vishnu Deo Sai, the next CM-designate of Chhattisgarh held the top organisational post in BJP’s Chhattisgarh unit. He served as Chhattisgarh BJP President from 2006 to 2013. His appointment also signalled a strong empowerment for the tribal community which was earlier witnessed when BJP-led NDA picked Droupadi Murmu for the Presidential post.   With all these new appointments, BJP signals that its motto ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’ (inclusivity) will be counter to the opposition’s push for caste census and proportional representation. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ","Center redefines terrorism in new criminal code, includes actions that threaten India’s economic security: Report ",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/center-redefines-terrorism-includes-actions-threatens-india-economic-security/,"The definition now includes threats to the economic and monetary security of the country through actions like using counterfeit currency or kidnapping, injuring, or causing the death of a public functionaryOn 12th December (Tuesday), the Union government revamped the legal definition of “a terrorist act”. Any action threatening India’s economic security will be treated as a ‘terrorist act’ under the new criminal code. The definition now includes threats to the economic and monetary security of the country through actions like using counterfeit currency or kidnapping, injuring, or causing the death of a public functionary, as reported by NDTV.#NewCriminalCode pic.twitter.com/g30k36MjeIAccording to Section 113 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, those who threaten, or are likely to threaten, the country by causing “damage to the monetary stability of India, by way of production or smuggling or circulation of counterfeit Indian paper currency…” commit a terrorist act.Notably, on 11th December, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had notified Lok Sabha that the three criminal law bills would be withdrawn. He added that the bills would be replaced with three new bills to incorporate the recommendations proposed by a parliamentary committee. Pertinent to note that the revised versions of all three were tabled in the Lok Sabha this evening (12th December).A Statement from the office of the Home Minister had said, “The bill (Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, and Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita) was referred to Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs on August 18 for consideration. The Committee held several rounds of discussion with the officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, domain experts, and various stakeholders and submitted its reports along with recommendations on November 10.”Apart from revamping the definition of terrorist act, the government has added two new sections to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. It is one of three bills that is now slated to replace current criminal laws, including the Code of Criminal Procedure. As per media reports, the first addition is the inclusion of Section 86. This newly added section includes harming a woman’s mental health in its definition of “cruelty”. Section 85 provided a three-year jail term for a husband, or members of his family, found guilty of subjecting his wife to cruel treatment in the previous version of the bill. However, the previous version didn’t define “cruel treatment” which has now been included, and the definition, significantly, extends to harming the woman’s mental health as well as her physical well-being. The second section prescribes a two-year imprisonment for disclosing the identity of a sexual assault victim from court proceedings without their consent.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

As per reports, an argument that turned violent broke out between Ayyappa devotees from Karnataka and Andhra and the temporary staff appointed by the temple administration.On 12th December (Tuesday), temple management staff and police allegedly manhandled and assaulted devotees in the Trichy Srirangam Temple premises, in Tamil Nadu. The injured Ayyappa devotees have been admitted to Srirangam Government Hospital for treatment. Notably, the Vaikuntha Ekadasi festival in Srirangam began today with the Tirunedum Thandakam festival and thousands of devotees visited Ranganatha in the morning. As per reports, an argument that turned violent broke out between Ayyappa devotees from Karnataka and Andhra and the temporary staff appointed by the temple administration.Several devotees, including Andhra Ayyappa Bakhtar Chenna Rao, were assaulted. Following this, Ayyappa devotees filed a police complaint against three temporary employees Selvam, Vignesh, and Bharat who are accused of assaulting the devotees as well as against the temple administration. As per reports, it is alleged that the police deployed in the temple premises, instead of supporting the assaulted Ayyappa devotees, supported the accused temple staff. They reportedly pushed the injured devotees out of the temple and tried to cover up the attack. Subsequently, more than a hundred Ayyappa devotees protested at places like Karthikai Gopuram and Flagpole against the assault on devotees and mismanagement. However, the police reportedly stopped Ayyappa devotees who were protesting. A video footage of the incident is going viral on social media which has created a stir among the devotees. Sharing the video of an injured Ayyappa devotee, BJP state president K Annamalai condemned the incident. He also launched a scathing attack on temple management authorities including Tamil Nadu’s Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Department (HR & CE). Annamalai asserted that a government that doesn’t believe in Hindu dharma has no business to oversee or control the management of Hindu temples. Taking to X, he wrote, “A government which has no faith in Hindu Dharma has no business to be in Hindu Temples. The Iyyappa devotees who have had 42 days of Vrath, with all devotion, wanted to pray to Ranganatha Swamy after their return from Sabarimala. The Iyyappa devotees questioned the long wait in the queue and special treatment to a select few who were assaulted near the sanctum sanctorum & which resulted in bloodshed inside the Temple premises.”  A government which has no faith in Hindu Dharma has no business to be in Hindu Temples.

Tamil Nadu BJP’s Trichy district unit will today hold a protest outside the Srirangam Ranganatha Swamy Temple against the TN HR&CE department, demanding the strictest action against those spoiling the sanctity of the Temple.” Meanwhile, Ayyappa devotees and opposition parties have been accusing the state governments of sabotaging the Sabarimala pilgrimage. Apart from Tamil Nadu, in Kerala, the opposition leaders have alleged that the Kerala Police have been diverted to ensure the statewide trip of CM Pinnrayi Vijayan rather than providing adequate police security for management and crowd control at Sabarimala pilgrimage. The devotees have been waiting for more than 20 hours in long queues. Several videos are doing rounds on the internet in which devotees have highlighted mismanagement for this year’s Sabarimala pilgrimage. In many cases, the police and temple management authorities have manhandled devotees for highlighting these issues. Reportedly, the devotees are facing an acute shortage of basic amenities like clean water and food, and one 11-year-old girl child died.  Fate of Ayyappa Devotees in Kerala !!!As u all know sabarimala pilgrimage is a significant annual Hindu pilgrimage in Kerala attracting millions of devotees.

Another feature is the pilgrims from other states coming under duress from the police force. The Vijayan government is now showing its anger towards the believers for their combined efforts to ensure all the religious protocols in place in Sabarimala are intact, which they got from the court. Vijayan government has to change its attitude and ensure all facilities are there for the pilgrims.” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Taking to X, PM Modi argued that India doesn’t need fictional series like ‘Money Heist’ as it has the Congress party doing ‘legendary’ heists for 70 years and counting. PM Modi said, “In India, who needs ‘Money Heist’ fiction, when you have the Congress Party, whose heists are legendary for 70 years and counting!”In India, who needs 'Money Heist' fiction, when you have the Congress Party, whose heists are legendary for 70 years and counting! https://t.co/J70MCA5lcGPM Modi made the above remarks while quoting a tweet shared by the official Twitter handle of the BJP. The quoted tweet had a video embedded in it. Congress presents the 𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐄𝐘 𝐇𝐄𝐈𝐒𝐓! pic.twitter.com/vp3BTheoshThe video highlighted the recent IT raids on Congress Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Sahu.

As per reports, it could breach the Rs 500 crore mark.   BJP’s tweet caption read, “Congress presents the 𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐄𝐘 𝐇𝐄𝐈𝐒𝐓!”. In the background, the video had the famous title track of the popular Spanish series ‘La Casa De Papel’ whose English spin-off ‘Money Heist’ has been among the most-watched series on OTT platforms. Incidentally, the series revolves around robbing banks. Cornering the Congress party and its leader Rahul Gandhi for their alleged closeness and support to party MP Dhiraj Sahu, the video shows the latter’s picture with Rahul Gandhi and party president Mallikarjun Kharge. BJP has been lambasting the grand old party for indulging in rampant corruption and asserting that it can’t run away from accountability for the recent disclosures of huge piles of unaccounted cash from the properties of its Rajya Sabha MP.  Notably, following the IT raids which unearthed hundreds of crores of cash from Sahu’s properties, Congress claimed that it had nothing to do with his businesses and only the accused could explain the source of such a huge pile of cash.देशवासी इन नोटों के ढेर को देखें और फिर इनके नेताओं के ईमानदारी के 'भाषणों' को सुनें… 😂😂😂जनता से जो लूटा है, उसकी पाई-पाई लौटानी पड़ेगी, यह मोदी की गारंटी है। ❌❌❌💵 💵 💵❌❌❌ pic.twitter.com/O2pEA4QTOjEarlier, PM Modi had slammed the Congress party while referring to the reports of Income Tax raids on Congress MP Dhiraj Sahu.

As per a report by Financial Express, the Housing Committee of Parliament forwarded the notice to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, asking Moitra to vacate her official residence. The decision was reportedly taken after expulsion from Lok Sabha in a cash-for-query case. She was expelled based on the recommendations of the Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha on 8th December.A notice has been issued to Mahua Moitra to vacate the bungalow as she is no longer a member of Parliament.Earlier, expelled Mahua Moitra moved the Supreme Court against her expulsion.

Moitra was expelled hours after the Ethics Committee report was tabled in Lok Sabha.On 14th October, the Indian political scene experienced a major tremor as BJP MP Nishkant Dubey wrote to the ethics committee seeking an inquiry against TMC MP Mahua Moitra in the ‘Cash for Query’ matter. He based his complaint on the letter written by Supreme Court lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai, who alleged that most of the questions asked by the TMC MP in Lok Sabha directly or indirectly benefit businessman Darshan Hiranandani. Dehadrai also accused Moitra of “kidnapping” his pet dog Henry, adding another layer of complications to Mahuagate.Moitra filed a case against Dubey and Dehadrai but never denied accepting gifts. Interestingly, she has also been accused of sharing her Lok Sabha credentials with Hiranandani so he can post questions independently. Hiranandani has reportedly turned approver in the case and submitted an affidavit suggesting the allegations against Moitra are true.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ",Ram Mandir priest Mohit Pandey defamed in fake porn pics: Gujarat Congress leader held for sharing morphed pictures,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/gujarat-congress-leader-hiten-pithadiya-held-for-sharing-morphed-pictures-of-ram-mandir-priest-with-a-woman/,"The Cyber Crime Branch of the Ahmedabad police apprehended the Congress leader Hiten Pithadiya on charges of disseminating manipulated images featuring a woman and the Ayodhya priest on various social media platforms.The Ahmedabad Police have arrested Gujarat Congress leader Hiten Pithadiya for sharing an obscene picture of a porn hero, projecting him as the priest of the under-construction Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The Uttar Pradesh police have also initiated action against the leader for malicious posts against the Ram Mandir priest.On 11th December, Congress party leader Hiten Pithadiya shared some inappropriate photographs on social media and claimed that the person in the photographs was Mohit Pandey from Ghaziabad, who has been recently appointed as the priest for the Ram Lalla Temple being built in Ayodhya. Notably, since Pandey’s appointment, a malicious campaign has been running against him on social media. Apart from Pithaidya, several other X handles shared the same fake photos.Pithadiya is the head of the Scheduled Caste Morch of Gujarat Congress. In his post on X, he posted photographs of a person seen in an objectionable position with a woman. He wrote, “Is this the priest of Ayodhya Ram Temple?”The assertions were made based on the fact that the person in the photographs was wearing tilak and sandalwood. Earlier, real pictures of Pandey were shared on social media where he was wearing tilak and sandalwood. Pithadiya and others made fake claims based on the common factors of tilak and sandalwood. In reality, the person in the photograph was not Pandey.Following the controversy, Hindus on social media shared screenshots of the objectionable tweets. They urged police in Ayodhya and Ahmedabad to take strict action against those spreading the disinformation against Mohit Pandey.प्रभारी निरीक्षक साइबर सेल को आवश्यक जॉच व नियमानुसार विधिक कार्यवाही हेतु निर्देशित किया गया।It was evident that Pithadiya shared the photographs because of his bias against the Ram Temple and the newly appointed priest Mohit Pandey. Following the backlash, Pithadiya deleted his tweets. However, by that time, the damage was done. Both Ayodhya Police and Ahmedabad Police initiated action against Pithadiya.Journalist Janak Dave said in a post on X that Ahmedabad Cyber Cell arrested Pithadiya under Sections 469, 509, 295A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant IT Act.कांग्रेस नेता हितेन्द्र पिठाड़िया की गिरफ़्तारी.IPC 469, 509,IPC 295A और IT act के तहत मामला दर्ज. https://t.co/Ju8tfynPfO pic.twitter.com/GeZrL25633The Cyber Crime Branch of the Ahmedabad police apprehended the Congress leader on charges of disseminating manipulated images featuring a woman and the Ayodhya priest on various social media platforms.Verifying the information, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Cyber Crime, Ajit Rajian informed Deccan Herald that Hitendra Pithadiya has been arrested on charges of sharing deepfake images of the woman. The charges include 469 (forgery), 509 (intending to insult the modesty of a woman), 295 A (Deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings), and relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act.Mohit Pandey is a young priest selected to serve at the Ram Lalla Temple built in Ayodhya. Pandey studied at the Dudheshwar Vedic University in Ghaziabad for seven years. He earned his Shastri degree, equivalent to a Bachelor’s degree, from Shri Venkateshwara Vedic University, associated with the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam in Tirupati. He completed his master’s degree while studying Samaveda. Furthermore, he is also a scholar of the Ramanandi tradition and has expertise in Vedas, Shastras and Sanskrit.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ",‘Uddhav met Modi and promised to leave MVA to form govt with BJP in June 2021’: Education Minister in Shivsena MLAs disqualification case,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/uddhav-met-modi-promised-to-leave-mva-to-form-govt-with-bjp-in-june-2021-edu-min-deepak-kesarkar/,"As per the Minister, Uddhav Thackeray, the then-chief minister, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on 8th June 2021. Ajit Pawar, the Deputy Chief Minister, and Ashok Chavan, a Cabinet Minister, were both present, Deepak Kesarkar claimed in his testimony to Speaker in the Shiv Sena MLA disqualification case. “Narendra Modi and Uddhav Thackeray met in June 2021. At that time, Uddhav Thackeray had promised Modi that he would leave the Mahavikas Aghadi and form the government with the BJP,” revealed Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar, the Shinde faction MLA while the Shiv Sena MLA disqualification hearing was underway. Deepak Kesarkar was cross-examined after Uday Samant in the Assembly on 11th December. He brought up the behind-the-scenes events that took place to form the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance at that time.The hearing of the Shiv Sena MLA disqualification case is underway before Assembly Speaker Rahul Narvekar. Uday Samant was cross-examined on Monday morning (11th December) and after that, Cabinet Minister Deepak Kesarkar was cross-examined.“I raised the issue of Shiv Sena Party’s objectives and ideology. I had changed Uddhav Thackeray’s mind by saying that BJP is a like-minded party and we should go with the alliance,” Kesarkar said while in the Assembly. As per the Minister, Uddhav Thackeray, the then-chief minister, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on 8th June 2021. Ajit Pawar, the Deputy Chief Minister, and Ashok Chavan, a Cabinet Minister, were both present. The three leaders’ meeting with Prime Minister Modi came to an end. Following that, Modi and Thackeray had a meeting.Uddhav Thackeray was going to join hands with the BJP and leave the Maha Vikas Aghadi. He had also sought 15 days after his meeting with Prime Minister Modi. However, he arranged to send a message to Prime Minister Modi through me to ask for more time. He wanted some time to explain the decision to the alliance members. I arranged for his message to reach Delhi. Most of the Shiv Sena leaders wanted to be in alliance with BJP, Kesarkar revealed. Kesarkar further asserted that Uddhav Thackeray took a lot of time in making the decision and hence, he disclosed the information to some senior party leaders including Subhash Desai, Anil Desai and Eknath Shinde. “I asked them to request Uddhav Thackeray to decide at the earliest”, Kesarkar said in cross-examination.The Supreme Court on 30th October ordered Maharashtra assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar to decide on the disqualification petitions against Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde and MLAs supporting him by 31st December. Earlier to that, the court had pulled up Narwekar for delaying the adjudication of the disqualification petitions. The court said it would fix a timeline if the speaker fails to submit a revised schedule expediting the process. The court also issued a warning that a decision on the disqualification pleas should taken before the next assembly elections, otherwise, the whole process would become pointless. After Shinde and 39 MLAs broke away from the parent party and sided with the BJP to form the government in 2022, the Sena factions filed an abundance of disqualification petitions against each other.In July, the speaker summoned 40 MLAs from the Shinde-led Sena and 14 from the Thackeray faction to respond to disqualification petitions filed against them. A total of 54 MLAs were served with the notices. On May 11, this year, the Supreme Court determined that Shinde would remain as Maharashtra’s chief minister. It also stated that it could not reinstate Thackeray’s Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government because he chose to resign without facing a floor test in the aftermath of Shinde’s rebellion.The Shiv Sena (UBT) however accused Narwekar of purposefully delaying a decision on the disqualification petitions.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ","Did Washington Post repeat Pakistani conspiracy theory about ‘Disinfo Lab’? Copy-paste journalism, reliance on lunatic who wanted Mamata Banerjee raped, claims about ‘SkinDoctor’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-disinfo-lab-article-on-pakistani-conspiracy-theory/,"Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Aveek Sen's misleading tweets on 'Disinfo Lab' became the primary fodder for both 'Pakistani Defence' and 'The Washington Post'.A day after The Washington Post carried out a hit job on Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, it has come to light that some of the outlandish claims made by the American newspaper bear an uncanny resemblance to conspiracy theories peddled by a Pakistani website.In an attempt to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’, The Washington Post claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.Although it relied on word salad, insinuations, ‘source-based’ allegations and dubious ‘experts’, the American newspaper failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of ‘Disinfo Lab.’Interestingly, a large part of the purported ‘investigation’ by The Washington Post on the Indian OSINT handle appears to be based on conspiracy theories peddled by a website named ‘Pakistan Defence.’In an article titled ‘Disinfo Lab – A Disinformation Project of Indian RA&W’, published by the website in February 2022, a staff writer Amaa’n relied on outlandish claims made by ‘journalist’ Aveek Sen to draw links between ‘Disinfo Lab’ and Indian Intelligence.The ‘Pakistan Defence’ article made references to Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy, Ajayendra Tripathi, and BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga – all of whom appear prominently in the propaganda piece of The Washington Post.The Pakistani website presented the accusations of Aveek Sen, an abusive troll, as the ‘gospel truth.’ In the tweet from 2013 that went viral, Aveek Sen was seen quoting TimesNow, saying that Mamata Banerjee had called the Barasat rapists ‘CPIM supporters’. To that, Aveek Sen had responded saying “Its high time these cpm supporters rape Mamata!”Prior to deleting his account, Aveek Sen had made several dergatory comments targeting women. A few of his archived misogynist tweets can be seen here – In several of his tweets, Aveek Sen was seen referring to women as ‘prostitutes.’Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Sen’s misleading tweets on ‘Disinfo Lab’ became the primary fodder for both ‘Pakistani Defence’ and ‘The Washington Post’. Interestingly, he had also collaborated with the likes of propaganda outlets such as Newslaundry.“And the making of Indian fake disinfo lab, copying the famous eu disinfo lab that exposed hundreds and thousands of fake Indian websites (By author Aveek sen),” read a line from the article on ‘Pakistan Defence.’Coincidentally, a similar language is used in the report published by The Washington Post. “Another person, a former employee, said the Disinfo Lab named and modelled itself after groups such as the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that researches disinformation targeting Europe,” it claimed.It claimed, “Some of the fronts, setup by Colonel Dibya Satpathy, per Aveek Sen’s revelation, include: Root N Wings Media, situated at B-3, Bali’s, Near BSES Office, Arya Samaj Mandir, Lajpat Nagar 2, Delhi. Flat A-20, Lajpat Nagar 3, near Ring Road, Delhi.”Interestingly, the claims made it to the report of The Washington Post as well. “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors working out of a four-story whitewashed building on a leafy street in New Delhi,” the leftist newspaper wrote.In another paragraph, it said, “The office operated under the name Root and Wings Media.” Based on Aveek Sen’s tweets, the shady Pakistani website alleged that Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy had been campaigning against the country on the behest of R&AW and BJP.OpIndia found yet another uncanny resemblance in the report of The Washington Post where it said, “The Disinfo Lab itself was headed by Satpathy, whose work has focused mostly on countering Pakistan.”“The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” the American newspaper claimed in another part of the article.Both The Washington Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ made specific references to ‘Root Wings Media’ and characterised it as a ‘social media marketing company/ campaign agency.’“The company has no more than ten employees, typical of an intelligence front,” the Pakistani website said. And this is what the American newspaper claimed – “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors.” Both The Washingon Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ targeted targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.“Some of the investigative reports published by this website include one aiming to discredit the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,” wrote ‘Pakistan Defence.’“The Disinfo Lab often cites publicly available U.S. lobbying and campaign finance records and produces complex flowcharts to illustrate alleged relationships. But the group draws tenuous connections, claiming, for instance, that a USCIRF commissioner was influenced by Islamists because she once worked on a conservative fundraising committee alongside a lobbyist who went on to represent Muslim American groups,” claimed The Washington Post.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.The Washington Post ensured to not include all conspiracy theories to set its ‘investigative article’ apart from that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ The Pakistani website had even dubbed popular member and dermatologist Neelam Singh aka ‘The Skin Doctor’ as an aide to R&AW officer Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy.“The Evil nexus of Col Dibya Satpathy Indian ex-military intelligence officer and bjp troll farms. To (sic) manufacture and spread propaganda and misinformation with the help of Major Neelam “Neel” Kumari alias “The Skin Doctor”, Major Gaurav Arya,” it claimed.‘Pakistan Defence’ accused ‘The Skin Doctor’ of carrying out the ‘evil nexus’ of supposed ‘Disinfo Lab’ founder and Indian Intelligence officerThe Washington Post did not copy-paste the outrageous claims about ‘Disinfo Lab’ only from ‘Pakistan Defence’ but another Pakistani-based website named ‘Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research (CSCR).Interestingly, CSCR published another misleading piece on ‘Disinfo Lab’ a year before that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ Habitual fake news peddler and anti-Hindu activist CJ Werleman had made similar insinuations about the Indian OSINT handle in February last year.First, the claim of our association with Govt agencies/ RAW. The report is essentially a recycle of previous reports published by Pakistani ISPR/ Info-war machinery. The report is periodically recycled, last by known fake news peddler CJ Werleman.Lazy Journalism!(2/n) pic.twitter.com/0oXNGfrVyoIn November 2021, CJ Werleman had appealed to boycott Indian products to supposedly ‘save’ Muslims in India and Kashmir. Before that, he had tweeted a video of Pramod Muthalik, the chief of the Hindu activist group Shri Rama Sene, to allege that he called for violence against Muslims and the demolition of a mosque in Karnataka. Earlier, he claimed Indians had destroyed a Muslim graveyard in Himachal Pradesh, which was also fake news. In August 2021 when the Islamist group Taliban took over Afghanistan, Werleman was caught spreading Taliban propaganda. In September 2021, he called for ‘regime decapitation’ strikes against India.The Print, run by Shekhar Gupta had eulogised Werleman in a profile describing him as a ‘bigot-turned-crusader against ‘Islamophobia’ who is taking on the Indian state’. Since every anti-India propagandist is a potential source of The Washington Post, there will surely be no dearth of more anti-India hit pieces ahead of the 2024 elections.While hitting out at The Washington Post, ‘Disinfo Lab’ pointed out that the only difference in its article and past hitjobs against it is the addition of unnamed sources. “The only ‘upgrade’ the WaPo did was to make this Pakistani allegation ‘anonymous’. And whatever is in addition to that is again attributed to ‘anonymous’ sources. Hence, literally, every fact claimed is ‘anonymous’. The report has more than 10 anonymous sources,” it added.As pointed out earlier by OpIndia, The Washington Post failed to refute any assertions made by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ It also noted, “While, in their questions to us and other people, WaPo journalists have themselves noted that our claims are factually correct! (thanks for acknowledgement), they alleged that we make ‘tenuous claims’, and cited a few examples.”While calling out the bluff of the leftist newspaper, Disinfo Lab concluded that The Washington Post is overrated. “It is not surprising that people who don’t understand OSINT are baffled by our reporting. It is especially hard for legacy media journos – Indian and foreign alike, who have known journalism only as handouts from sources. Agencies are overrated. OSINT is underrated,” it emphasised.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"12 December, 2023 ",Opposition forced to use ‘dirty money’ due to electoral bonds: Raghu Ram Rajan steps out to defend Congress MP linked to 500 cr Income...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/rbi-governor-raghu-ram-rajan-congress-income-tax/,"Dr Rajan, who joined Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra last year on the economy, came out in defence of UPA-2 and claimed that the country did not progress much during 2009-2014 because UPA-2 was not in the majority. In an interview published by The Red Mike on 12th December, former Governor of Reserve Bank of India, Dr Raghuram Rajan, gave a bizarre “context” to the unaccounted cash recovered from Congress Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Prasad Sahu. Dr Rajan claimed that the opposition parties are “forced” to use illicit money because electoral bonds provide an unequal playing field favouring the ruling party.In his question, Sanket Upadhyay asked Dr Rajan about his views on electoral bonds, citing the statement given by former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg at Idea Exchange. Garg thoroughly explained why electoral bonds were introduced and what the ill effects of removing them from the system would be. Sanket asked Dr Rajan about his views on the statement where Garg said that if electoral bonds are removed, it will be cash on the streets yearly in the political process.Dr Rajan asserted electoral bonds are an utterly non-transparent way of financing. Parties receive funds, and what they get is not known to anyone. In case an industrialist gives 1,000 crores to a party, the public can never know. He further called it a “bad way of financing elections” as the only people who know who donated what are the State Bank of India. He claimed that in India, it is hard to maintain secrets, and the ruling party can find the information of the business houses that donated to the opposition parties.Dr Rajan speaks on the Dheeraj Sahu cash recovery in the context of Electoral Bonds. Do listen to his views below. Full intw – https://t.co/HTcXOGc7cW pic.twitter.com/cD9yHKKTUoDr Rajan said, “I do not say it happens, but the ruling party can call up the people who gave money to the opposition parties and ask them why they donated to so and so party.” He further claimed that this is why opposition parties must use cash instead of electoral bonds. “Elections are fought on money,” he added.Furthermore, he said that for the elections, the ruling party could use agencies like the Enforcement Directorate, the Income Tax Department, and the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct raids against the leaders of the opposition parties. For example, in the recent attacks against Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, Dr Rajan asserted that the money could have been used to fight elections.What is notable here is that even the Congress party could not develop this bizarre theory. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh categorically stated the party had nothing to do with the money recovered from premises linked to Sahu. While the Congress party distanced itself from the controversy, Dr Rajan felt it necessary to explain why so much cash was stored at premises linked to Sahu.Dr Rajan, who joined Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra last year on the economy, came out in defence of UPA-2 and claimed that the country did not progress much during 2009-2014 because UPA-2 was not in the majority. He said that Goods and Service Tax (GST) was introduced during UPA-2 but could not be implemented as opposition parties opposed it. UPA-2 was not in the majority, so it could not be made a law. Notably, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was in opposition then. Can you believe?Raghuram Rajan now says policy paralysis of UPA 2 was fault of opposition!He is crying that UPA did not have big enough majorityLOL… Nehru dynasty had big majorities for 40 years… they took India's economy DOWN from 6th to 12th largest! pic.twitter.com/XlLfXhz9xJIn a way, he blamed the BJP for the “policy paralysis” during UPA-2. Rajan said, “Parliament was not allowed to function. You can’t solely point a finger and say nothing happened. There was partial paralysis; that was was opposition-led also.”Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress from Jharkhand. His family has been associated with the Congress party since independence. He became Rajya Sabha MP in by-polls in 2009 for the first time. In 2010, he was re-elected as RS MP for the second time; in 2018, he was re-elected for RS by Congress for the third time.Dhiraj Sahu actively participates in parliamentary proceedings. Sahu was also part of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra. In recent raids at Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Pvt Ltd, where Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner, the Income Tax Department recovered over 400 cr of unaccounted cash. Congress Party has distanced itself from their own MP after the recovery of the cash.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

There are no substantially approved rules and regulations on proper conduct and discipline of students by the statutory body (i.e Executive Council) of JNU in vogue.”The pamphlet mentioned that a student (repeat offender) would be expelled if he or she was awarded 5 (five) or more punishments during the entire duration of the study.Punishments have been listed for 28 types of “misconduct”, including blockage, indulging in gambling, unauthorised occupation of hostel rooms, use of abusive and derogatory language and committing forgery.For hunger strikes, dharnas, group bargaining and any other form of protest by blocking the entrance or exit of any of the academic and/or administrative complexes or disrupting the movements of any member of the University community, a fine of up to Rs 20,000 will be levied.Students can be fined up to Rs 6,000 for holding events without prior permission, and/or they may have to carry out JNU Community Service.For printing, circulating or pasting posters/pamphlets (text or picture) carrying derogatory religious, communal, casteist or anti-national remarks and any activity that incites intolerance towards religion, caste or community and/or anti-national in nature which disturbs the peaceful atmosphere on the campus, a student can be fined upto Rs 10,000.The JNU Students Union has condemned the new manual saying it is aimed at stifling the vibrant campus culture that has defined the university for decades.“Such excessive regulations are intended to discourage open discussions, dissent, and intellectual exploration, which are fundamental to the spirit of our university. According to the new manual, protests before any academic building can lead to rustication, eviction from the hostel and a fine of Rs 20,000. Moreover, a student who commits any act that the JNU Admin considers to be of moral turpitude can be fined up to Rs 10,000,” the statement read.
